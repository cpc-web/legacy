Since its conception, Central Park Conservancy has benefited from the foresight of generous friends who have included the Conservancy in their wills, knowing that by doing so Central Park would endure long into the future. </p>
<p>By carefully considering your gift to Central Park in conjunction with your estate and financial planning you can take advantage of some creative opportunities that can help you maximize your assets. These gifts, tailored to your individual circumstances and needs, ensure that the beauty of Central Park will be enjoyed by future generations. </p>

<div id=""testimonial1"" style=""display: none;"">

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">
<img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/support-images/LornaSass.jpg"" align=""left"" style=""margin:5px !important;""> When I moved to the Upper West Side in 1969, Central Park was a do-not-enter zone. It was in such a state of neglect &mdash; and a danger at night &mdash; that I had to take the bus to make my way across town. Throughout the 1980s, and the decades thereafter, I marveled at how the Central Park Conservancy transformed the Park from an uninviting, barren space into the joyous, nourishing place I now call my backyard.
</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">I understood the importance of the Conservancy&rsquo;s work and the need for New Yorkers to support its mission, but concerns about rising costs and approaching retirement had held me back from making the kind of substantial annual contribution I thought the Park deserved. After procrastinating for about 30 years, I decided it was high time to write my will. That&rsquo;s when I had an &ldquo;aha!&rdquo; moment: I realized that when I no longer have to worry about monthly maintenance, grocery, and utility bills, my savings and the revenue from the sale of my co-op would allow me to be a philanthropist.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Then the fun really began. After making bequests to family members, I listed all of my favorite charities. The Conservancy immediately came to mind.</p> 

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">A simple call to the Conservancy&rsquo;s Office of Planned Giving was all it took to learn how to remember the Park in my will and make sure that my wishes were honored. What a thrill it is to know that my contribution will help keep my beloved Central Park the glorious work of art and nature it has become. &mdash;Lorna Sass</p>

<div id=""testimonial2"" style=""display: none;"">

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">
<img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/support-images/LynnBarber.jpg"" align=""right"" style=""margin:5px !important;""> For many New Yorkers, the City&rsquo;s cultural institutions are like old friends. Central Park has been a lifelong friend of Lynn Barber. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve visited the Park since I was a little girl,&rdquo; Lynn said. &ldquo;My aunt used to take me. I thought the big rocks by the zoo were elephants with their heads buried in the soil. I would ask her who let them out.&rdquo; Since then, her love of the Park has only deepened. &ldquo;My perfect day is one where I&rsquo;m just free to wander. And when I think of wandering, I think of Central Park. It&rsquo;s the treasure of the City.&rdquo; <p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">When she wants to relax, Lynn sits by the cafe at the Conservatory Water (familiarly known as the model boat pond) to enjoy the area&rsquo;s serenity and &ldquo;rejuvenate.&rdquo; Lynn believes the common experience of enjoying the Park brings people together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve established some real friendships just sitting there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met artists and authors, it&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p> 

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Like an old friend, Lynn cares about the health and future of Central Park. So, after years of support as a member of the Central Park Conservancy, she decided to give in the most generous way she can &ndash; by making the Conservancy a beneficiary of her 401(k). &ldquo;People often don&rsquo;t realize the options they have with retirement savings,&rdquo; Lynn said. 

<p style=""text-align:justify;""> In most cases, adding a beneficiary is simple. &ldquo;It just takes one phone call or a few minutes online,&rdquo; Lynn said. Since it&rsquo;s so easy to do, it&rsquo;s also easy to undo. There are no fees for setting it up, and no penalties for changing your mind. With her retirement many years away, Lynn said that making the Conservancy a beneficiary has given her a sense of security. &ldquo;I want to know where my savings are going. Central Park is perpetual; it will always be part of the City.&rdquo; </p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""> And, with the continued help of donors like Lynn, the Park can always look as good as it does today.</p>

They were determined to end Central Park's dramatic decline&nbsp;in the 1970s and&nbsp;restore it to its former splendor as America's first and foremost major urban public space, as envisioned by its 19th-century designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Today, the Conservancy's mission is to restore, manage and enhance Central Park, in partnership with the public, for the enjoyment of present and future generations.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Conservancy and the City of New York signed a management agreement formalizing their then 18-year public-private partnership. The relationship was reaffirmed in 2006 when the agreement was renewed for an additional eight years. As the official manager of Central Park, the Conservancy is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operation of the Park. Presently, 90 percent of the Park's maintenance operations staff is employed by the Conservancy, which provides the majority of Central Park's $58.3 million annual Parkwide expense budget through its fundraising and investment revenue. The City, in addition to the annual fee to the Conservancy for the services it provides, funds lighting, maintenance of the Park drives and enforcement. The <a href=""http://www.nycgovparks.org/"" target=""_blank"">New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation</a> retains policy control, has discretion over all user permits and&nbsp;events in the Park, and&nbsp;provides 10 percent of the field staff.</p>
<p>Since its founding, the Conservancy has overseen the investment of $690 million into Central Park, of which $536 million was raised from private sources &mdash; individuals, corporations and&nbsp;foundations &mdash; and more than $110 million was contributed by the City. The Conservancy has also prescribed and&nbsp;carried out a restoration management plan for the Park; managed the capital restoration of much of the Park's landscapes and&nbsp;facilities; created programs for volunteers and visitors; and set new standards of excellence in Park care. It has transformed Central Park into a model for urban parks worldwide. Helping other parks is a natural extension of the Conservancy's core mission. As such, it provides technical, management and fundraising advice to park systems around the country and world.</p>
<p>In 1986, the Conservancy launched its first fundraising campaign, Campaign for the Central Park Conservancy, which resulted in the restoration of Bethesda Terrace, Grand Army Plaza, Shakespeare Garden, Cedar Hill, and the southern part of the Park. In the early 1990s, capital projects focused on the northern end of the Park, culminating in the restoration of the Harlem Meer. Through the Wonder of New York Campaign in the mid-1990s, the Conservancy restored the west side landscapes, the Great Lawn and the North Meadow. In 2005, the Conservancy launched its third campaign, Campaign for Central Park, which is funding the restoration of landscapes from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Harlem Meer around the 22-acre Lake. This campaign also provides long-term operating support.</p>
<p>Conservancy crews care for 250 acres of lawns, 24,000 trees, 150 acres of lakes and&nbsp;streams and&nbsp;80 acres of woodlands; install hundreds of thousands of plantings annually, including bulbs, shrubs, flowers and&nbsp;trees; maintain 9,000 benches, 26 ballfields and&nbsp;21 playgrounds; preserve 55 sculptures and&nbsp;monuments, as well as&nbsp;36 bridges; remove graffiti within 24 hours; collect over 5 million pounds of trash a year; and provide horticultural support to City parks.</p>
<p>Conservancy public programs take advantage of the invaluable resources in Central Park, each year providing education, recreation and&nbsp;volunteer programs that serve children, teenagers, adults, families, community organizations and&nbsp;schools. In addition, the Conservancy provides visitor services at the six centers in the Park: Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, Belvedere Castle, Dairy Visitor Center &amp; Gift Shop,&nbsp;Chess&nbsp;&amp; Checkers House and Tavern on the Green Visitor Center &amp; Gift&nbsp;Shop,&nbsp;as well as at the North Meadow Recreation Center.</p>

<p>Update effective February 27, 2009</p>","The Central Park Conservancy cares about the privacy of our members, online users, donors and visitors. This privacy policy outlines the Concervancy's policies and proceedures regarding information.",devnull@convio.com,"Sep 29, 2009 02:35 PM CDT",/about/inside-the-conservancy/privacy/,Default,TRUE,,,none,,,,"privacy, policy, information, e-mail, email, online, direct mail, marketing, donors, data, personal information",,,,,,,,About the Central Park Conservancy,inside-cpc.html,"<p><strong>A Public/Private Partnership</strong></p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""item-461254628"" style=""display: inline;""></div>
<p>In 2013, the City of New York awarded the Central Park Conservancy a new management agreement to ensure the continued maintenance of Central Park. Originally signed in 1988 and renewed in 2006, the 2013 contract affirms the City's confidence in its more than thirty-three year partnership with the Conservancy.</p>
<p>Under the current ten-year agreement, the Conservancy provides for the Park's day-to-day care, as well as certain maintenance work outside Central Park. &nbsp;Specified in the contract are: landscape and lawn maintenance, tree care, horticultural work, graffiti removal, cleaning playgrounds and comfort stations, repairing benches, clearing walkways, cleaning drains and sewers, and maintaining and repairing monuments and certain park structures.</p>
<p>The Conservancy receives an annual fee for the services it provides. The amount of this fee is determined using a formula that requires the Conservancy to raise and spend a specified minimum amount of private funds in the Park on an annual basis. &nbsp;Since 1980, the Conservancy has invested nearly $700 million in Central Park operations, capital improvements, and programs for visitors and volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>The City of New York's Role in Central Park<br /></strong>The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. Capital improvements in the Park continue to undergo public review at each stage of development, with advice and consent from the Commissioner of Parks &amp; Recreation. In addition, the City of New York/ Parks &amp; Recreation manages and collects fees from all concessions in Central Park, and is responsible for scheduling and permitting &nbsp;events in the Park, but carries out these responsibilities in consultation with the Conservancy.</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-441706908"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>The Conservancy's Qualifications</strong><br />The Central Park Conservancy is uniquely qualified to manage Central Park. Since 1980, the Conservancy has managed the Park with its partner, the City of New York, and brought the Park back from its deteriorated state in the 1960s and 1970s to its present condition by restoring and maintaining major landscapes and historic structures. The Conservancy is a model for public-private partnerships for parks throughout the country, and has developed an accomplished staff of park management professionals.</p>
<p>The Conservancy also has an impressive track record in raising private funds to improve and preserve Central Park. Since its founding in 1980, the Conservancy has invested nearly $700 million in private dollars, which, combined with the City's investment, has turned Central Park into a living symbol of New York City's revitalization.</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-441706909"" style=""float: right; margin-left: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>The Conservancy's Governance<br /></strong>The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. The Parks Commissioner and officials of the City of New York/Parks &amp; Recreation Department are involved in all Park planning, and must approve all of the Conservancy's capital improvements in the Park. The Conservancy, however, as a private not-for-profit organization, has a separate 52-member Board of Trustees. &nbsp;The Board consists of 43 general trustees representing the business and philanthropic communities, four ex-officio trustees (the Parks Commissioner, the Manhattan Borough President, the Central Park Administrator, and the President of the Women&rsquo;s Committee), and five Trustees appointed by the Mayor of the City of New York. &nbsp;Additionally, there are currently 13 Life Trustees. See the&nbsp;<a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/about/inside-the-conservancy/governance-overview.html"">Governance Overview</a>&nbsp;page for more information.</p>
<p><strong>The Conservancy's Community Outreach and Public Review Process<br /></strong>Central Park will always be a public park, and the Conservancy will continue to involve the public in the planning of improvements to the Park. &nbsp;For any project, the Conservancy obtains approval from the Parks Commissioner, engages in extensive community outreach to neighboring Community Boards, and submits its plans to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Design Commission for review and approval.</p>
<p>Advisory boards comprised of community residents work with the Conservancy on a range of projects and issues. Current advisory groups include the Woodlands Advisory Board and the Central Park Recreation Roundtable. &nbsp;New and expanded advisory groups are created as needed to address plans for new projects and programs.</p>","In 2013, the City of New York awarded the Central Park Conservancy a new management agreement to ensure the continued maintenance of Central Park.

Founded in 1983 by four visionary women, the Women's Committee has been instrumental in increasing awareness and raising funds for many Park projects including the reconstruction of the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, the renovation of Safari Playground, and recreation of the urns at Bow Bridge. The Women's Committee raises nearly 15 percent of the Conservancy's $58.3 million annual, Park-wide budget.</p>
<p>The Women&rsquo;s Committee is proud to host three of New York&rsquo;s premier charitable events: the Frederick Law Olmsted Awards Luncheon, the Fall Luncheon and the Annual Family Party in Hecksher Playground. With a membership of over 1,000, the Committee is responsible for the operation of many Park-wide programs including Adopt-A-Bench, Tree Trust, Playground Partners, Daffodils and Tulips Donations, Perimeter Association, and Conservancy Docents.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<p>Dr. Irving Newhill is 75 years old. He used $10,000 cash to establish a charitable gift annuity for the eventual benefit of Central Park Conservancy. He receives:</p>
<ul>
<li>guaranteed payments for life at 5.8% ($580 annually)</li>
<li>$469 of annual payment is tax free</li>
<li>a&nbsp;charitable deduction of $4,186</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Newhill could have chosen to defer the income from his gift for 3 years, until he is 78, and it would have increased both the rate of the payments when they began and the deduction he received for his gift. It would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>guaranteed payments for life at 7.0% ($700 annually)</li>
<li>$484 of the annual payment is tax free</li>
<li>the charitable deduction, which he can take in the year he makes the gift, increases to $4,915</li>
</ul>

It enables you to make a substantial gift to Central Park Conservancy over a period of years. These trusts, usually funded with an income-producing asset that is expected to appreciate, pay an income to the charity. At the end of the term, the assets can either revert back to you or pass to those you designate, typically your children or grandchildren. A minimum gift of $100,000 is recommended.</p>
<p>Please note that appreciating assets such as stocks, real estate, and cash, are the best for funding a charitable lead trust because the assets pass to your heirs with the appreciation and without additional tax.</p>
<p>For Example<br />Mr. Hill runs around the Reservoir in Central Park every morning. He enjoys the improvements to the track and the plantings that now grow there. Mr. Hill wants to create an endowment to help with the revitalization and upkeep of this area. He is also considering how to transfer part of the family business to his son who is still quite young. By establishing a charitable lead trust he can: </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a stream of income to the Conservancy for a number of years </li>
<li>Claim a gift tax charitable deduction that will help to offset, if not eliminate entirely, the tax on the gift of the property to his son. Even if the value of the property appreciates significantly, there will be no additional tax when his son receives the property at the end of the trust term. Additionally, his son does not take on the burden of business decisions until he is older </li>
<li>Remove the property from his taxable estate <br />Have the pleasure of seeing his endowment created and know he is providing meaningful support for the Conservancy's work in Central Park. </li>

Because a Charitable Remainder Trust is tailored to your specific needs, you determine the length of the trust and the payout rate &mdash; both of which have an effect on the tax deduction.Charitable remainder trust is a formal trust agreement through which donated assets are irrevocably transferred to a trustee (one or more individuals, a bank, or a trust company) and in return you and/or another designated person will receive income for life or for a term of years. Upon completion of the term, the assets then pass to Central Park Conservancy to support Central Park.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of charitable remainder trusts.</p>
<ul>
<li>An annuity trust that pays a fixed income</li>
<li>A unitrust that pays a variable income</li>
</ul>
<p>Since charitable remainder trusts are flexible they can be set up to supplement retirement funds, provide educational funds for children or grandchildren, or provide support for someone you care about. They can be created during your lifetime or through your will and may have substantial tax benefits.</p>

<p>For Example:<br />Sylvia Green is 82 and a widow. She has loved spending time in the Park her entire life and, in addition to enjoying its beauty, has long been fascinated by its history. Mrs. Green decides to create a charitable remainder trust that will eventually provide for the restoration and maintenance of the Park's bridges, arches, and historic structures.</p>
<p>She funds the trust with $200,000 of appreciated securities she has held for many years, which are currently yielding only about 3 percent, and sets up the trust to pay 6 percent. She knows if she sells the stock and purchases a higher-yield issue the tax on the appreciation will consume almost a third of the proceeds, leaving considerably less to reinvest. The term of the trust she establishes is for her lifetime. At the end of that time her gift will pass to Central Park Conservancy to create an endowed fund in her name for the maintenance and preservation of the historic structures throughout the Park.</p>
<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/support-images/charitable-remainder-trust-chart-a.gif"" /></p>
<p>By establishing the trust she has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubled the income from her assets.</li>
<li>Avoided the capital gains tax that would be due if she had sold the stock in order to reinvest it.</li>
<li>Generated a substantial tax deduction.</li>
<li>The satisfaction of knowing she has helped preserve the history of Central Park.</li>
</ul>
<p>Appreciated assets, cash, unencumbered real estate, and retirement accounts are excellent assets to consider. No capital gains tax is due on the transfer, and you receive an income tax charitable deduction for a portion of the contribution in the year the trust is established.</p>
<p>Because Central Park Conservancy does not act as trustee, a minimum gift of about $150,000 is recommended.</p>

These assets, if sold, would result in taxable gains. By making a gift of securities that have been held for at least twelve months, taxes on the appreciation are avoided and a charitable income tax deduction is realized for the full fair market value of the assets.</p>
<p>Please note that a donor considering a gift of an asset that has declined in value would be better advised to sell the property in order to realize a deductible loss, and then contribute the proceeds to charity. This assures recognition and deductibility of the loss in addition to the income tax charitable deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Life Insurance<br /></strong>There are several ways to use life insurance for charitable purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you own a policy that is no longer needed for the protection of your heirs, you may use it to make a gift to Central Park. You can do this by naming Central Park Conservancy as the owner and irrevocable beneficiary of the policy. In doing so, you are eligible to take an income tax deduction for the lesser of premiums paid or the policy's fair market value. If you then continue to pay the premiums to maintain the policy then the payments are considered charitable contributions.</li>
<li>In conjunction with an outright gift or a life income gift, you can replace the dollar value of the asset with life insurance for your heirs. The tax savings from your gift is often enough to cover the cost of the insurance. The asset is not included in your estate and your children can receive it tax free.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retirement Accounts</strong><br />Reduce your taxes by designating the Conservancy as a beneficiary of your retirement plan. If you are planning to include Central Park Conservancy in your estate plans, the best asset to use may be the remainder of your retirement plans, such as an IRA or your 401k. These assets may be subject to very high taxation if left to anyone other than a spouse. Designating the Conservancy to receive any benefits remaining in your retirement plan may effectively reduce the taxes that would otherwise be imposed on those accounts that have grown tax free. Retirement plan assets can also be used to create a testamentary charitable remainder trust.</p>

<P>As the Conservancy&rsquo;s historian, she appears on radio and television as a Park spokesperson, conducts specialized tours, and lectures.</P>
<P>As the Conservancy&rsquo;s photographer, Sara has shot thousands of photographs of Central Park, from its dark days in the 1980s through its 25-year renaissance. She documents the Conservancy&rsquo;s milestones and events, and keeps a stock library of Park photographs, many of which have been published in magazines and newspapers around the world. She also manages the publication of the Conservancy&rsquo;s annual report.</P>
<P>A national authority on Central Park, Sara has written a book, Central Park, An American Masterpiece, published by Henry N. Abrams, Inc. in 2003, which explores the Park&rsquo;s history and facets of its art and design.</P>
<P>Her images are also featured in the Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s new Central Park Photography Collection, an assembly of her photographs celebrating the splendor of one of the world&rsquo;s great public spaces.</P>
<P>Sara is particularly known for her work interpreting the artistic and historical significance of the Park&rsquo;s 18 gates, the intricate carvings at Bethesda Terrace, and many of the Park&rsquo;s sculptures. She is currently working on her next book, which will delve further into the history of the Park.</P>
<P>Sara received a Masters in Art History from Hunter College, a Master of Fine Arts Photography from Pratt Institute, and an undergraduate degree from Syracuse University.

<p>Help the Conservancy meet the information needs of Central Park's 40 million annual visitors.&nbsp; Whether they are from far away places, or are New Yorkers who use the Park regularly, many need help navigating the Park, or have general interest questions. Enhance their experiences by greeting, guiding and informing them, whenever possible, about the importance of Central Park Conservancy's role in the Park and much more. Training is provided for each type of greeter or guide, and we ask for a two-year commitment to the Greeter/Guide program.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Greensward Guides</strong></span><br />Greensward Guides generally work in pairs, walking in pre-designated areas of the Park greeting visitors, giving directions, answering Park-related questions, informing about upcoming events, teaching good Park stewardship and more.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Kiosk Greeters and Visitor Center Greeters</strong></span><br />Kiosk Greeters assist visitors from one of the three information kiosks inside the Park: West 60th Street near Columbus Circle, East 72nd Street near Fifth Avenue, and West 72nd Street near the West Drive.&nbsp; Kiosk Greeters work solo.</p>
<p>Visitor Center Greeters support the facility staff by helping out at one of four Park visitor centers: Chess &amp; Checkers House, Belvedere Castle, the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, and North Meadow Recreation Center.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Training</strong></span><br />Whether you work in a Kiosk, a Visitor Center, or as a Greensward Guide, all Greeter/Guide positions require some prior knowledge of the Park and the same amount of training. This includes a mandatory group interview and three classroom sessions, and then one-on-one mentoring in the Park by a number of our experienced Greensward Guides.</p>
<p>Once training is completed you can schedule your shift for either a weekday or weekend morning or afternoon. Along with asking for a two-year overall commitment, we also ask Greeter/Guides to commit to three hours per week (must be the same day and time-slot each week).</p>

<p>People are answering recent calls to service, looking for meaningful ways to lend a hand in their communities. Here in Central Park, we invite you to Pitch In, Pick Up!</p>
<p>At 843 acres, there's a lot that goes into maintaining New York City's ""backyard"" everyday. The Central Park Conservancy's dedicated staff keeps the Park lush and vibrant, but we need your help, too.</p>
<p>Our Pitch In, Pick Up volunteer program makes it easier than ever to be a part of your Park. Just stop by one of the Conservancy's visitor centers and sign out a volunteer name-tag , and choose either a trash-grabber or sweeper. Then pitch in by helping us pick up litter.</p>
<p>With more than 40 million people visiting Central Park each year, every stray napkin and tossed bottle adds up. Help us keep the Park clean and green, whether you have an hour or an afternoon to give.</p>
<p>Drop by one of our visitor centers at these locations to get a jump on cleaning in Central Park!</p>

<p><strong>The Central Park Challenge: A professional development program located in the heart of New York<br /></strong>Whether your company is large or small, success often depends on forming a cohesive group of people. Understanding the strengths, limitations, and potential of each team member is integral to improving a company's performance. The Central Park Challenge Professional Development Program can help your executives learn to create synergies and a sense of teamwork among diverse employees.</p>
<p>Building peak performance teams is what separates the best companies from the rest.</p>
<p>The Central Park Challenge Professional Development Program is designed to help you take your team to a higher level of performance. The heart of the program is learning through experience. Through a series of progressively more challenging activities, participants together as s team, they gain the interpersonal skills vital for success.</p>
<p>Using the North Meadow and Woodlands of Central Park as our classroom, we place groups of your executives in an unfamiliar environment giving them only the basic tools necessary for solving problems. We then challenge them with goals that demand teamwork, trust, and tenacity. Through group discussions, we tie these experiences together and develop a framework for understanding core team values. Each participant shares what he or she has learned and how it can be applied to the business environment.</p>
<p><strong>Realize Your Potential</strong><br />All exercises are designed to foster team dynamics, communication, leadership, flexibility, and risk assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Programs Designed to Build Upon Your Strengths, Overcome Weaknesses, Help You Achieve Your Goals</strong><br />A Program Coordinator will meet with you to tailor a program that fits your company's structure. In order to accommodate the unique character and needs of your organization, your culture and needs. You may select half-day, one-day, or two-day programs. Programs may be scheduled at any time of the year, in a variety of indoor or outdoor settings. Adventure components such as rock-climbing and orienteering can be added.</p>
<p><strong>A Special Challenge Program is Available for Companies Involved in Youth Mentoring<br /></strong>While adventure activities help develop management and teamwork skills, they are also ideal for enriching adult-to-youth mentoring relationships. If your employees are currently involved in a youth mentoring program, our Challenge is ideal for growing relationships. Through a series of one-on-one and group exercises, the concepts and consequences of success, failure, self-esteem, and goal setting are addressed in a specially designed package. Group discussion follows each Challenge exercise, during which experiences and impressions are examined and applied to a broader life context.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications<br /></strong>All programs are well within the capabilities of those in moderate physical condition, regardless of age or gender. Safety is our highest priority. All program instructors are experienced group leaders with qualified first aid and CPR training.</p>

Cross-Park routes at 102nd. St and 72nd St. allow cyclists to shorten the distance or to detour the most challenging hills which are in the north. &nbsp;There is also a shared cross-path inside the Park at 96th Street for slow-riding commuters and groups of four and under. The Drives are ONE-WAY roads with arrows indicating the counter-clockwise direction for all vehicles and bicycles. All cross-routes are two-way for cyclists.</p>
<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/bicycling.jpg"" style=""margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;"" />The Drives that circle the Park have a dedicated bicycle lane that is in the middle of the road. The bicycle lane is marked to direct slower cyclists to use the left side of the lane and faster cyclists to ride on the right side. Cyclists must use extra caution on the southern end of the Park where the Drive narrows and requires cyclists to share a lane with motor vehicles for a short stretch.</p>
<p>The Drives are open to public vehicular traffic at different times on weekdays when cars will be traveling in the vehicle lane that is on the right side of the dedicated bicycle lane. &nbsp;On weekdays, the entire West Drive and 72nd St. cross are open to traffic from 8:00 am. &ndash; 10:00 a.m.; the Center Drive from 6th Ave north to E. 72nd is open to traffic from 7:00 a.m. &ndash; 7:00 p.m.; The East Drive from E. 72nd north to Adam Clayton Powell Blvd is open to traffic from 3:00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m. The Drives are all closed to traffic on weekends and holidays, but the vehicle lane is used heavily by service and Parks vehicles so cyclists should not travel in it except to cautiously pass other cyclists who are in the bicycle lane.</p>
<p>No permit is required to bike in Central Park, however there are several laws and rules that every cyclist must obey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedestrians have the right of way at all times.</li>
<li>At crosswalks, cyclists must slow down, yield to pedestrians and then proceed cautiously.</li>
<li>Cycling is prohibited on all pedestrian paths&nbsp;except the marked shared paths at 96th St and W. 106th-108th St.</li>
<li>Cycling is prohibited on landscapes.</li>
<li>Cyclists are required to obey all traffic laws, such as traffic signals, stop signs, and the maximum speed limit of 25 mph. The Drives are multi-use areas and can be very congested on weekends and nice days. Cyclists are required by law to travel at a slower safe speed in response to crowd, emergency, or weather conditions.</li>
<li>NYC law requires that children under 14 years of age wear a helmet, but it is recommended that all cyclists wear a helmet.</li>
<li>Obey all ONE WAY signs and arrows: Travel only counter-clockwise on the Drives that circle the Park.</li>

<p><strong>Catch-and-Release fishing program for 2013 runs from April 16 through October 5.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Program Hours</strong></p>
<p>Mon-Sat: 10:00 am - 3:00 pm (poles must be returned by 4:00 pm)</p>
<p>Sun: 10:00 am - 1:00 pm (poles must be returned by 2:00 pm)</p>
<p><strong>Rules and Regulations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release fish gently.</strong> All fishing is on a ""catch-and-release"" basis only, meaning that all fish caught must be put back into the water immediately. Please wet your hands before handling fish, and release while the fish is underwater if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Use safe fishing equipment. </strong>The use of barbed hooks&nbsp;and&nbsp;lead sinkers is strictly prohibited. Monofilament line should be properly discarded of in the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center to avoid harming wildlife.</li>
<li><strong>Respect the turtles and waterfowl.</strong> If you see a turtle or bird near your hook, please move to another spot to avoid catching it.</li>
<li><strong>Please fish with complimentary fish bait</strong> from the Dana Center ONLY. The use of bread products and hot dogs as bait is discouraged as it has been found to be harmful to both the wildlife and the water bodies.</li>
<li><strong>Don't feed the wildlife.</strong> Feeding any other wildlife and digging for worms is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li><strong>Stay on pathways, ramps and steps</strong> next to the water. Excessive trampling of the natural shoreline and wading in the water kills the grass and causes soil erosion and compaction. This creates poor living conditions for plants, fish and other Meer dwellers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Free&nbsp;for families and individuals. Groups of&nbsp;five or more people must make reservations at least two weeks in advance.&nbsp;For more information, call&nbsp;212-860-1370. Group reservations are taken for Monday to Friday only, for either of the following two-hour sessions: 10:30 am - 12:30 pm, or 1:30 pm - 3:30 pm.</p>
<p>Recommended for children ages 5 to 15 and accompanying adults.

<p>Whether you are distance walking, hiking, taking a stroll or a Conservancy or other walking tour, you can walk on the drives, along pathways, the Reservoir, the bridle paths or any of the pathways.</p>

<p>A soft surface on a 2 degree&nbsp;slope, the Reservoir running track is 1.58 miles around and offers some of the best skyline views in the Park and many scenic variations. In the spring the cherry trees along side it are in bloom and in the summer the evaporating water cools the surrounding air.</p>
<p>There are three conjoined soft surface bridle paths to choose from. The Reservoir loop, adjacent to the Reservoir, totals 1.5 miles; the North Meadow loop totals 1.1 miles; and the southern spur totals 1.5 miles.</p>
<p><strong>Hiking<br /></strong>There are 58 miles of trails in Central Park. Some of those trails can be found at the Ravine in the Park's North Woods and the Ramble with its 38 acres of woodlands, wild gardens and rock outcrops.</p>
<p><strong>Strolling</strong><br />In addition to the areas above, the Great Lawn's 15 acres and its surrounding paved pathway are perfect for a leisurely stroll. Sheep Meadow, Wien Walk, the Dene, Cedar Hill, the Mall and the Park's six-mile perimeter also provide beautiful vistas for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>Walking Tours<br /></strong>The Central Park Conservancy offers a number of different guided&nbsp;walking tours free of charge to the public.</p>
<p>One can walk at any time in the Park though it is officially closed from 1 am-6am. If you are taking one of the many walking tours, be sure to check the schedule. The Drives are closed to traffic Monday through Friday, 10am-3pm and from 7pm-10pm, and on weekends from 7pm Friday to 6am Monday. When the Park is open to traffic a walkers' lane on the Park Drives is always available, but we do not recommend using the Drives when they are open to traffic.</p>","Central Park's 250 acres of lawns and 80 acres of woodland offer a multitude of landscapes, trails and pathways for everyone from the serious hiker to the recreational stroller.",rlynn@centralparknyc.org,"Dec 10, 2009 11:07 AM CST",/visit/things-to-do/sports/,Default,TRUE,,,recreation-sports,,,/assets/images/visit-images/walking-m.jpg,"walking, hiking, racewalking, race walking, speed walking, speedwalking",,"/visit/things-to-see/reservoir/running-track.html,/visit/things-to-see/north-end/ravine.html,/visit/things-to-see/great-lawn/ramble.html,/visit/tours/guided-tours/index.html",,,,/assets/images/visit-images/walking-s.jpg,/assets/images/visit-images/walking-t.jpg,Chess & Checkers,chess-and-checkers.html,"<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/chess-s.jpg"" style=""float: left; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 15px;"" />There's nothing quite like a good game of chess or checkers while surrounded by the natural beauty of Central Park.

In 1979, under the new Central Park Administration, the restored Dairy became the Park&rsquo;s first visitor center, and in 1981, the loggia was returned to its original Victorian elegance by the newly formed Central Park Conservancy. Today the Dairy is the Park&rsquo;s premier gift shop.</P>

The open-air shelter, made from unmilled timber, was built atop a large rock outcrop. Children and their caregivers sat at rustic chairs and tables to play games that they could borrow from the Dairy. After many years of neglect and disrepair, the structure was torn down in the early 1950s. In 1952, the present brick Chess and Checkers House was built and chess tables were placed around it, making it a haven for enthusiasts of both time-honored games. In 1984, the Chess and Checkers House was refurbished and a wisteria pergola was added. In May 2007, it reopened as the official visitor center for the Park&rsquo;s south end and as the volunteer headquarters. Visitors can borrow different games and sit at the 24 chess tables under a modern-day pergola to match wits and enjoy the summer shade.</P>
<P><STRONG>Wollman Skating Rink</STRONG><BR>When the Park was being planned, <A href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/south-end/wollman-rink.html"">New Yorkers demanded a place for the new sport of ice skating</A> because the rivers surrounding the island of Manhattan rarely froze. Immediately, the Pond and the Lake&nbsp;- both man-made water bodies&nbsp;- became the most popular winter destinations in the Park. Frustrated by the whims of Mother Nature, however, Park visitors wanted the guarantee of ice skating all season long. In 1950, Kate Wollman donated the money for the rink, which was placed on the northern arm of the Pond. In the 1980s, the rink was reconstructed by the City of New York with assistance from real estate developer Donald Trump, whose organization manages it today.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary<BR></STRONG><A href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/south-end/pond.html"">The Pond is one of the Park&rsquo;s masterpieces</A> of engineering and technology. Designed to resemble a quiet woodland lake, it is actually lined with geosynthetic materials and filled with city water by subterranean pipes. Concrete shelves, constructed along the naturalistic shoreline, feature many plants and shrubs that contribute to the impression of a bucolic lagoon set deep in the woods. From the 1870s until 1924, visitors to the Pond could ride on swan boats, still a famous attraction at the Boston Public Garden. The Promontory is a rocky woodland slope that juts into the Pond. In 1934 it was renamed <A href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/south-end/hallett-nature-sanctuary.html"">the Hallett Nature Sanctuary</A>, set aside for wildlife and closed to the public.

Placed atop Vista Rock, it overlooks the old reservoir (now the Great Lawn). Designed in the Norman Gothic style, the Castle is constructed of the same Manhattan schist as its promontory, giving it the magical appearance of rising out of the rock itself.</p>
<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/selftour-middle.jpg"" style=""float: right; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px; border: black 1px solid;"" />The United States Weather Bureau set up offices in the Castle in 1919 to monitor and report New York City's weather. In the early 1960s, the Weather Bureau installed automated meteorological instruments, and the staff vacated the building. The empty Castle deteriorated into a sad, graffiti-covered ruin. In 1983, it was restored by the Central Park Conservancy and became a popular visitor center and nature observatory. The weather instruments remain on the Castle's tower and monitor New York City's weather around the clock. When you hear &ldquo;The weather in Central Park is&hellip;&rdquo; on the radio or television, remember the information comes from Belvedere Castle in Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>King Jagiello and Turtle Pond<br /></strong>This imposing statue by Polish sculptor Stanislaw Ostrowski (1879-1947) portrays <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/great-lawn/king-jagiello.html"">King Jagiello, the Grand Duke of Lithuania</a>, who united Lithuania and Poland after marrying the Queen of Poland. The monument depicts the moment preceding his victory at the Battle of Grunewald of 1410 when the King crossed the two swords - handed to him by his adversaries, the Teutonic Knights of the Cross - above his head.</p>
<p>The sculpture was chosen in 1939 for the entrance to the Polish Pavilion at the World's Fair in New York. That year, the Nazis invaded Poland, preventing the sculpture's return to its homeland. In 1945 it was placed in Central Park by the Polish government as a symbol of the proud and courageous Polish people.</p>
<p>The King Jagiello statue is located at the eastern end of <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/great-lawn/turtle-pond.html"">Turtle Pond</a>, which attracts migrating birds and waterfowl and three species of turtles. The snapping turtles can reach nearly 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter, and can be seen sunning themselves at the waterline of Vista Rock. The nature blind, a platform that juts out into the northern side of Turtle Pond, is a wonderful place from which to observe wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>Obelisk<br /></strong><a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/great-lawn/obelisk.html"">This 3,500-year-old monument</a> stands directly behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. To celebrate the 30th year of his reign, Egyptian pharaoh Thutmosis III (c. 1479-1425 B.C.) commissioned a pair of obelisks for the sacred city of Heliopolis. In 12 B.C., they were moved to Alexandria, where they stood until the 19th century, when all great cities around the world clamored for an ancient Egyptian obelisk. The Khedive of Egypt gave one obelisk to England in 1879 and the other to America in 1881, in exchange for foreign aid to modernize his country.</p>
<p>On a snowy January 22, 1881, thousands of proud New Yorkers celebrated the turning of Central Park's 220-ton obelisk (nicknamed &ldquo;Cleopatra's Needle&rdquo;) to an upright position. The renowned filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, who fondly remembered playing in the area as a boy, donated the plaques that translate the hieroglyphics.</p>
<p><strong>Great Lawn</strong><br />Very few people know that <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/great-lawn/great-lawn.html"">the Great Lawn, a luxurious green area at the geographical center of Central Park</a>, was originally the site of the Croton Reservoir completed in 1842, fifteen years before the construction of Central Park began. With the City's increasing need for water, plans for a new water system rendered this reservoir obsolete. The reservoir was drained in 1931, filled in, andopened as a luxurious green oval in 1937.</p>
<p>The Great Lawn is better known as the venue for famous concerts and events, beginning in the 1970s. Concerts by Elton John, Diana Ross, Simon and Garfunkel, and Luciano Pavarotti; the exhibit of the AIDS Quilt; the visit of Pope John Paul II; and the film premier of Disney's Pocahontas drew enormous crowds, causing severe damage to the lawn. In addition, the site still held the subterranean walls of the old reservoir, which prevented adequate drainage, and by the 1980s the Great Lawn had turned into the &ldquo;Great Dustbowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From 1995 to 1997, the Central Park Conservancy and the City of New York undertook the largest single restoration in Central Park's history - the 55-acre area covering the 13-acre Great Lawn Oval and its surrounding landscapes. The Great Lawn is once again the setting for ballgames, sunbathing, and picnicking; the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic each give their two traditional performances a year. All these activities are carefully monitored in accordance with the management guidelines instituted to ensure the continuing health of the Great Lawn.</p>
<p>The Great Lawn is a particularly good place to admire some of the Park's more than 20,000 trees. The Arthur Ross Pinetum at the northern end of the Oval features 15 species and five varieties of pines. The twin linden trees inside the middle of the eastern edge of the Oval mirror each other, their intertwined branches forming an elegant heart-shaped silhouette.</p>","This tour includes Belvedere Castle, the King Jagiello statue, Turtle Pond, the Obelisk and the Great Lawn.

<p>In the 1660s, the British governors constructed the Kingsbridge Road, an east side highway that linked the growing port at the southern tip of Manhattan Island to Harlem and the British colonies to the north. The road crossed over the swamp by a series of low-lying bridges and passed through the only narrow break in the wall of steep rocky cliffs that line the southern shore of the Meer today. That opening became known as McGown's Pass, a site that played a significant role in the American Revolution. When British ships attacked the indefensible New York colony in September 1776, the British army marched up the Kingsbridge Road to McGown's Pass and captured the fortification that was placed at the pass. For the next seven years, British and Hessian troops occupied this strategically important area until their defeat in the Battle of Yorktown in 1783.</p>
<p><strong>Conservatory Garden<br /></strong>The majestic trees of North America were a source of great national pride in the 19th century and many of the entries for the 1858 design competition suggested that an arboretum be included in the Park. Olmsted and Vaux envisioned their arboretum for the northeast corner of the Park - now the site of the Conservatory Garden and the Harlem Meer. The arboretum was never established, but the Park's first formal garden - the Conservatory Garden - was created in 1898 when a large E-shaped greenhouse was constructed at Fifth Avenue and 105th Street. It featured an indoor winter garden of exotic tropical plants and outdoor decorative Victorian flowerbeds. In 1937, the deteriorated greenhouse was demolished and a new six-acre formal garden was designed for the site.</p>
<p>The garden is divided into three distinct styles: French, Italian, and English. The French-style garden - closest to the Meer - features an ellipse of meandering boxwood and pansies, and showcases spectacular seasonal displays of tulips in spring and chrysanthemums in autumn. In the center is the charming Three Dancing Maidens fountain by German sculptor Walter Schott. The central Italian garden features an elaborate wrought-iron entrance gate and a wisteria pergola, a large lawn surrounded by clipped hedges, a 12-foot-high jet fountain (3.7 meters), and two exquisite all&eacute;es of pink and white crabapple trees on either side of the lawn. To the south is the English-style garden, featuring sculptor Bessie Potter Vonnoh's lovely Burnett Memorial fountain surrounded by flowering trees, beds of perennials and annuals, and a woodland slope.</p>
<p><strong>Fort Clinton</strong><br />During the War of 1812 New Yorkers assumed that the British would attack from the southern tip of Manhattan Island, and they built forts in that area accordingly. But in fact the British stormed Long Island Sound at Stonington, Connecticut on August 1814. New Yorkers became fearful that the enemy would sail west through Long Island Sound and attack Manhattan from the north. In August and September several fortifications were built on the high cliffs that flanked the Kingsbridge Road (also known as the Albany/Boston Post Road). From that vantage point, the American troops could see any advancing ships from the Hudson and East Rivers and the Long Island Sound, as well as any armies coming from the northern end of Manhattan. Named after Mayor DeWitt Clinton, Fort Clinton was one of four fortifications on the site that is now Central Park. Although soldiers were stationed at the fortifications, the British never attacked New York City, and in 1815 the Treaty of Ghent ended the war.</p>","This tour includes Conservatory Garden, the Charles A.

It is so naturally part of the Manhattan environment that many people may not realize it is entirely man-made.</P>Pre-1858<BR>In the mid-1800s, 500,000 people were living in New York City, with most city dwellers housed in crowded, cramped quarters below 38th Street. To escape the din of city life, people sought refuge in such pastoral spaces as Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.<BR><BR>The first public figure to champion the need for open green space within the city was Evening Post editor William Cullen Bryant. In 1844, he called for the creation of a large public park. Landscape gardener Andrew Jackson Downing joined Bryant in his pleas and together they pressed officials to set aside land before it was swallowed up by the fast-developing city. In a moment of rare political consensus, both parties at that time endorsed the idea of a large public park. Between 1853 and 1856, the commissioners paid more than $5 million for land from 59th Street to 106th Street, between Fifth and Eighth Avenues. 
<P>Then, in 1857, the independent board of commissioners sponsored a public competition to design the new Central Park.</P>1858 - 1871<BR>Out of 33 entries, the commissioners chose the <EM>Greensward </EM>plan by Frederick Law Olmsted, superintendent of the Park work crews and Calvert Vaux, the British architect who had convinced the commissioners to hold a design competition. 
<P>The varied terrain of the topography set aside for the Park invited pastoral, picturesque and formal landscapes, all of which were included in Olmsted and Vaux's plan. Achieving their vision, however, was a challenge to both architect and engineer, as the area was rocky, swampy and muddy. The soil was inadequate to sustain the trees and shrubs Olmsted and Vaux planned, so 500,000 cubic feet of topsoil was carted in from New Jersey. Lacking modern machinery, workers manually dug up earth and blasted out huge boulders with gunpowder. More than 10 million cartloads of materials and debris were carted in and out on horse-drawn carts. Thirty-six bridges and arches were built and six man-made water bodies, fed from the City's water supply, were created.</P>
<P>Andrew Haswell Green served as comptroller and treasurer of the board of commissioners from 1857 to 1871, when the Park was under construction. Green recognized the brilliance of Olmsted and Vaux's plan when other commissioners were ready to dismiss it. It is because of Green's support and protection of the <EM>Greensward </EM>plan that so much of Central Park is true to its original design. </P>1872 - 1933<BR>Most of the landscapes of Central Park were completed twenty years after the design competition was announced. Hampered by an endless series of political battles, Olmsted and Vaux officially resigned many times for either aesthetic or political reasons. Olmsted was finally removed in 1877; Vaux stayed on and off until his death in 1895. In his 1882 essay ""Spoils of the Park"" Olmsted noted that because of Central Park's uniqueness it needed an innovative form of management. He recommended that an executive office, a skilled landscape architect and an unpaid and informed board of directors oversee the decisions for the Park.
<P>Together, Olmsted and Vaux are considered to be the founders of the profession of landscape architecture in America. Despite the challenges of building the Park, its immediate success launched the urban parks movement of the 19th century.</P>
<P>Near the end of the century, the public demand for recreational space and the advent of automobiles placed new pressures on the Park. In the 1910s and 1920s, however, neglect posed an even greater threat to the Park than sporting events or cars. For decades after Vaux's death, there were only intermittent efforts to improve the lawns, replace dead trees and shrubs, or to end littering and vandalism. </P>1934 - 1966<BR>The election of Fiorello LaGuardia in 1934 gave Central Park a powerful advocate. LaGuardia unified New York's five parks departments and handed the reins to Robert Moses, who had built Long Island's first parkways and created Jones Beach. Moses immediately set out to clean up the Park.
<P>Soon, flowers bloomed where there had been bare dirt, reseeded lawns returned to lush green, walks were repaved and drinking fountains repaired. The City filled in the lower Reservoir with earth to create the Great Lawn. But Olmsted and Vaux's original vision for rural scenery was of minor interest to Moses, whose generation saw the need for recreational facilities. During the Moses' 30-year tenure, he secured New Deal funds to underwrite the costs for playgrounds, ballfields, handball courts and the Wollman Rink. He also raised money from individuals to create such popular attractions as the Hans Christian Andersen and Alice in Wonderland sculptures, the Chess and Checkers House and the Carousel. In 1964, Central Park was declared a National Historic Landmark. </P>
<P>The early 1960s saw the start of some popular annual performances in the Park. In 1962, the Public Theatre's ""Shakespeare in the Park"" debuted. In 1961 and 1965, the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic, respectively, began their series of summer performances on Sheep Meadow. </P><BR>1966 - 1978<BR>Already declared a National Historic Landmark, Central Park was named New York City's first Scenic Landmark in 1974, although neither designation secured funds for the Park's much needed restoration or maintenance.
<P>Moses's departure from his position as parks commissioner in 1960 marked the beginning of a twenty-year period of decline for the Park. The Park was the setting for summer concerts, New Year's Eve celebrations, peace rallies, protest marches, Love-Ins and Be-Ins. But these public gatherings took a heavy toll on the Park's landscapes. The once-green grass, trampled on and without proper maintenance, began to look more like a dust bowl than a great lawn. Broken park fixtures were strewn about, benches were missing their wooden slats and the tops of lampposts were missing. Graffiti covered almost every available stone or wood surface. </P>1979 - 1981<BR>By the late 1970s, the condition of Central Park had so deteriorated that a number of advocacy groups were formed to raise money, volunteers and awareness of the situation. Chief among these groups were the Central Park Task Force and the Central Park Community Fund. Needing an entree into the direct care of the Park, they approached Mayor Edward Koch and Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis. Under their leadership, the Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980. William Beinecke was named Chairman and Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Barlow (now Rogers) filled the newly created post of Central Park Administrator. Thus began a new phase of in the life of Central Park.
<P>The City and the Central Park Conservancy worked together to begin the long process of restoring the Park. The City issued bonds to fund a variety of capital projects while the Conservancy sought private funding to complement the City contributions. Work unrolled on Sheep Meadow, the Dairy and the Pond.</P>
<P>1982 - 1992<BR>In the early 1980s, the Central Park Conservancy commissioned ten studies of the Park, covering its topography, hydrology, architectural features, circulation, drainage utilities, trees and other vegetation, as well as a security analysis and a Park user study. The results of these studies were used to create Rebuilding Central Park: A Management and Restoration Plan. Published in 1985, this master plan focused public and private resources on three tasks: rebuilding the Park's architectural heritage (both structural and landscape); re-greening the Park and providing constant horticultural care for its meadows, woodlands and gardens; and providing programs and security for Park visitors.</P>
<P>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Conservancy worked with the City on many joint restoration projects. The Parks Department's capital funds, for example, paid for the early restoration of Belvedere Castle while the Conservancy raised money for the surrounding landscape. The design work for the restoration of the Harlem Meer was funded in 1986 by a private grant. In 1990, public monies funded the dredging of the Meer and the removal of its Moses-era concrete curbing. Private monies then paid to plant a naturalistic shoreline and to build The Charles A. Dana Discovery Center. </P>
<P>This era saw the completion of many other projects, including the reopening of Conservatory Garden, the restoration of Shakespeare Garden, Strawberry Fields and the Conservancy's first woodland restoration project that included the cascades in the Ravine. Also during this period, the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy created its Adopt-A-Bench, Tree Trust and Playground Partners programs, all of which continue to raise private funds to support Conservancy initiatives.</P>
<P>1993 - 2009<BR>1993 marked the start of the Central Park Conservancy's ""The Wonder of New York Campaign."" With the overwhelming support of thousands of individual New Yorkers, foundations and corporations, the three-year campaign raised nearly $77.2 million. At the centerpiece of this fundraising effort was the restoration project that would transform the ""Great Dust Bowl"" into the 55 acres surrounding the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond.</P>
<P>To effectively maintain the Park, the Conservancy instituted a revolutionary new zone management system in 1995. The Park was divided into 49 zones, each with a dedicated gardener who provides a uniformed presence and is held accountable for his or her zone. </P>
<P>In February 1998, a new era began when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern and Conservancy Chairman Ira Millstein signed a management contract between the City and the Conservancy intended to ensure the continuing maintenance, capital restoration and public programming for the Park. This contract affirmed the City's confidence in its nearly twenty-year partnership with the Conservancy. Under the agreement, the Conservancy receives an annual fee for services, determined by a formula based upon the Conservancy's success in raising and spending a specified minimum amount of private funds in the Park on an annual basis. </P>
<P>Since the creation of this public/private partnership, the Conservancy has completed many more projects as part of its mission to restore, manage and preserve Central Park for the enjoyment of present and future generations. These include the restoration of the Reservoir landscapes and fence, installation of the irrigation system at Sheep Meadow and the restoration of the Pond and the Pool. Most recently, the Conservancy completed the restoration of the Heckscher Playground and Ballfields, the West 110th Street Playground and Minton Tile Ceiling at Bethesda Terrace, a historic preservation project that entailed the detailed restoration and reinstallation of 49 panels with almost 16,000 elaborately patterned encaustic tiles.</P>
<P>On the night of August 18, 2009 a violent thunderstorm with straight-line in excess of 80 mph tore through the northern end of Central Park. In less than half an hour the storm cut a swath of destruction unlike anything seen in the Park's history. Some 500 trees were wiped out and another 1000 badly damaged. The estimated cost for clean up and recovery is approximately $3 million.</P>2010 and beyond<BR>Thanks to the generosity of many individuals, corporations, foundations and the City of New York, the Conservancy has invested more than $450 million to date into the Park, making it a model for urban parks worldwide. The Conservancy provides 85% of Central Park's $27 million annual operating budget and is responsible for all basic care of the Park. In addition, the Conservancy funds many public programs in the Park, from cultural series such as the Harlem Meer Performance Festival, to sports and recreation activities like climbing and fitness programs and volunteer-led free walking tours. Educational programs such as Central Park Scholars and Camp Central Park promote learning and leadership to the next generation of Park stewards.
<P>Just as in the time of Olmsted and Vaux, Central Park is once again a leader in the urban parks movement. The Conservancy model has set new standards of excellence in park care, with parks across the city and around the world replicating the model. While the Conservancy's primary mission is the care of Central Park, helping other parks is a natural extension of our core mission. The Conservancy's technical and managerial expertise in horticulture, design, construction and administration is helping to bring other parks to higher standards and, in doing so, improving the quality of life for communities across the city.</P>
<P>Today Central Park has never been more beautiful or better managed and the Conservancy is proud to be the leader of the Park's longest period of sustained health and beauty. Olmsted and Vaux would be gratified that their beloved masterpiece is at last under the expert care of an executive who is both an able manager and a professional landscape architect, Conservancy President and Central Park Administrator Douglas Blonsky and a caring Board of Trustees, under the leadership of Thomas L. Kempner Jr., that not only plans for the Park today but plans for the Park's future. Mistrustful of city government, Olmsted never could have imagined the consummate professionalism of today's Parks Department under the leadership of Commissioner Veronica White. </P>
<P>As we complete the transformation of the Park, the next challenge is to secure its future and stop the cycles of decline that have plagued the Park throughout its history. Through long-term planning and the establishment of an endowment for Park care, the Conservancy is working to ensure the continued maintenance of New York City's 843-acre oasis. <A href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/donate/"">With your support</A>, the Conservancy can continue to restore, manage and preserve Central Park, for present and future generations.</P>",Central Park has a long and facinating history.

<p>If you love helping people as much as you love the Park, volunteer your time as a Greensward Guide. These trained volunteers act as Park ambassadors, greeting and guiding the Park&rsquo;s visitors.</p>
<p>""Our Greensward Guides tell us how much fun they have volunteering in the Park,"" says Mary Cregg, the Conservancy&rsquo;s supervisor for volunteer services. ""They really enjoy meeting visitors from around the world, and get a lot of satisfaction from being able to help people &ndash; whether directing them through the Park or explaining the Conservancy&rsquo;s mission.""</p>
<p>Greensward Guides work in pairs, walking through pre-designated areas of the Park. They give directions, answer Park-related questions, educate users about good Park stewardship, and inform them about upcoming events. Best of all? They get to spend a few hours every week in one of the world&rsquo;s great public spaces.</p>
<p>Training is provided, and volunteers have the flexibility of working any day of the week between 9am and 5pm. A three-hour commitment is required.</p>

<p>The Conservancy maintains 98 recycling bins throughout the Park.&nbsp;This year, that number will more than double to 236 bins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Every year we expand our recycling program, and this is the next step for spring 2010,"" says Maria Hernandez, the Conservancy&rsquo;s Director of Horticulture. ""Environmentally conscious New Yorkers and visitors understand the need to keep moving forward with recycling efforts, both in and out of the Park.""</p>

While Parkgoers flock again to their favorite warm weather spots, they might not realize all the behind-the-scenes prep it takes Conservancy staff to get Manhattan&rsquo;s famous green space ready for its close-up.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;April is a big month for us,&rdquo; says Neil Calvanese, the Conservancy&rsquo;s vice president for operations. &ldquo;Now is when the Park really comes alive.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Before welcoming back spring&rsquo;s picnic blankets and recreation-seekers, about 250 acres of lawn needed prepping and mowing. In fact, the Park&rsquo;s annual rite of spring came this week with the first mow of Sheep Meadow &ndash; 15 lush green acres in the south end of the Park voted last summer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Sunbathing Spot&rdquo; in NBC New York&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Local&rdquo; poll.<br />&nbsp;<br />While March and early April are crunch-time for Conservancy field staff, a bulk of their lawn work actually takes place in the fall &ndash; the best time to restore the Park&rsquo;s turf and ensure it dazzles in the warmer months. Lawns are aerated and seeded, weeds eradicated, and the ground prepared for bulbs. This season, look out for the more than 70,000 tulips Conservancy gardeners and zone volunteers planted last fall.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another sure sign of spring in Central Park?&nbsp;The&nbsp;opening of ballfields at Heckscher, Great Lawn and North Meadow West Side, fields 1 - 6. (North Meadow East Side ballfieds 6 - 12 will open Saturday, April 24). But before the crack of the season&rsquo;s first bat, Conservancy staff must test the soils, regrade the fields, add clay, and put in the pitchers&rsquo; mounds. All the backstops get checked and lines painted. The work doesn&rsquo;t stop there. The Conservancy maintains the fields through the spring and summer for the more than 12,000 softball and baseball permits issued each year. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Our staff does a tremendous job,&rdquo; says Russell Fredericks, the Conservancy&rsquo;s chief of operations. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dedicated to keeping Central Park&rsquo;s lawns as green and pristine as they&rsquo;ve come to be known for in the nation&rsquo;s most frequently visited urban park.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />So mark your calendars and keep checking back for updates.

<p>With each season their numbers ebb and flow. In recent weeks the Park&rsquo;s raccoon population has greatly expanded, and tests have come back positive for rabies. Since the discovery, the Central Park Conservancy has been reporting to the Department of Health and the Parks Department, who are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>More recently, the Conservancy is aware a coyote has been spotted in the Park. Such sightings are actually not uncommon - in 2006, a male coyote was rescued in the Park. The Conservancy is reporting sightings to the Parks Department and will update the public with any pertinent information. </p>
<p>Central Park is New York City&rsquo;s backyard, and we want you to enjoy every acre of it. Please take these small, common sense steps to help us keep our natural habitats healthy while enhancing your own Park experience.</p>
<p>Respect the wildlife. Never feed or approach a wild, stray, or injured animal. If you see something, say something: call 311 or notify a Conservancy employee. <br />Keep all dogs leashed. Pets can run off-leash before 9 am and after 9 pm. All other hours, they must be leashed. Keep a close eye on your dogs at all times and kindly share with non-compliant pet owners the importance of following these rules.&nbsp; <br />Carry in, carry out. Be sure to dispose all your litter in the trash and recycling bins located throughout the Park. Better yet, carry out all the items you carried in with you. </p>

<p>The Playground Captains program, which started in the early 1990&rsquo;s and was revived in the fall of 2009, empowers families to work together to improve their local playground: their &ldquo;backyard.&rdquo; It is a great way to meet neighbors and build community ownership.

Don't fret: the iconic fountain is undergoing conservation work and is expected to be back in view with its waters flowing by mid-June.<br />&nbsp;<br />As part of the Conservancy's program of cyclical conservation and maintenance, staff will be working on the sculpture's bronze and masonry elements over the next few weeks. Our conservation team will strip the sculpture's existing lacquer, condition the bronze, ameliorate the weathered patina and restore a sustainable hot wax coating &ndash; all to protect the bronze from the elements and preserve the celebrated fountain for generations to come. <br />&nbsp;<br />The masonry repair includes repointing, which is replacing mortar in the joints of the masonry, and restoring several sculptural elements in the bluestone base of the fountain.

<p>If you've had the pleasure&nbsp;of strolling&nbsp;by the Harlem Meer lately, you probably enjoyed a scenic view that was hard to imagine 20 years ago, when the land lay in deterioration. Since 1993, the Central Park Conservancy has made incredible&nbsp;efforts to restore this forgotten landscape with the introduction of native plant and fish species.&nbsp;The now-flourishing habitat supports many species of wildlife including largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegill sunfish, carp and chain pickerel.</p>
<p>Each June, the Conservancy celebrates fish and helps families learn about aquatic ecology at this free&nbsp;annual event. Featuring&nbsp;a build-a-fish&nbsp;craft, catch-and-release fishing, microscopic explorations of the Meer with the <a href=""http://www.nyms.org/"" target=""_blank"">New York Microscopial Society</a>, and live performance art.</p>

<p>Rock out in your favorite Central Park playground at free Sandbox Programs, the Conservancy's longest-running series of programming, celebrating its 24th consecutive summer in 2013! Featuring dance, music and stories, these Sandbox Programs happen in&nbsp;different playgrounds all over Central Park on weekdays at 11am and 2pm.</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox Dance:</strong> Feel the rhythm and learn some new moves! Co-presented with Museum for African Art.</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox Music:</strong> Learn to accompany live brass instruments with your own percussion under the guidance of professional teaching musicians from Central Park Brass.</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox Puppets:</strong> Watch Ant and Grasshopper, Cat and Mouse, and many other characters tell folk and fairy tales brought to life by puppeteers from Wonder Spark Puppets.</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox Stories:</strong> Hear stories about goblins, shoemakers, witches, princesses, fools and much more performed by New York City based storyteller Dan Kitrosser.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""We love the exposure to different cultures with the African dance, exposure to musical instruments in the music program and the wonderful storytellers. I wish it lasted longer until school begins. When people ask why we live in NY, this is the reason. It's an informal introduction to culture that kids don't get elsewhere.""<br />- Phillipa Zamir, Sandbox Program participant, 2011</p>
<p>For children ages 3 to 8 years old and accompanying adults. No advance registration. All programs are FREE. Inclement weather will cancel these events. For more information, call 212-348-4867.</p>

Crews are working to stabilize the shoreline and restore its naturalistic character, while also rebuilding paths and overhauling storm drainage and irrigations systems. The phase will wrap up with restoration of the surrounding lawns and landscape and aquatic plantings.<br /><br />The work at Cherry Hill is part of the Conservancy's comprehensive restoration of the Lake, begun in 2006 to rebuild the eroded shoreline and reclaim silted-in coves and inlets. Completed projects include Bank Rock Bay, the Point and Oak Bridge. <br /><br />In restoring the Lake, the Conservancy found a smart, sustainable solution in a material called coir logs &ndash; interwoven coconut fibers bound together with biodegradable netting. Staked at the base of the slope where the normal water level meets the shoreline, the logs protect the Lake's edge from birds and wave action erosion until plants can become established.<br /><br />While the restoration at Cherry Hill will conceal a treasured Park view through summer, the work will result in much-needed improvements to the Lake's ecology and its scenic beauty. That means a healthier habitat for Park wildlife and a more picturesque spot for visitors to enjoy.</p>","The next stage of the ongoing restoration work at the Lake is underway, with the Conservancy now focusing on reconstruction of the Cherry Hill shoreline.",jklimkiewicz@centralparknyc.org,"May 13, 2010 02:57 PM CDT",/visit/inside-central-park/,Default,TRUE,,,central-park-news,,,/assets/images/visit-images/cherry-hill-construction-m.jpg,"the lake, cherry hill, shoreline, erode, coir logs",,,,,,/assets/images/visit-images/cherry-hill-construction-s.jpg,/assets/images/visit-images/cherry-hill-construction-t.jpg,Taste of Summer 2010 Silent Auction,taste-of-summer-auction.html,"<p>Taste of Summer features a high-end silent auction of luxury goods, unique experiences and travel adventures.&nbsp;The 2010 auction boasted over 50 packages including:</p>

<p>Tucked in Central Park's north end, the six-acre <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/north-end/conservatory-garden.html"">Conservatory Garden</a> is one of New York City's hidden gems. Thanks to the watchful eye of Garden curator Diane Schaub and the green thumbs of her talented staff, the Park's only formal garden is spectacular in every season. <br /><br />We talk with Diane to find out how she creates this floral work of art, what inspires her and what it's like to work in one of the most enchanting places in the Park.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come to be curator of Conservatory Garden - surely one of the most coveted horticultural jobs in New York City?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Luck, good timing and training &mdash; and did I mention luck?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />In spring of 1994, I was a recent graduate of the New York Botanical Garden School of Professional Horticulture, having left the world of film editing &mdash; a form of pruning another kind of deadwood. A friend working with Lynden B. Miller, director of the Conservatory Garden, who had rescued the Conservatory Garden from decades of neglect, told me about an open assistant curator position at the Garden. I applied and was hired. </p>
<p>In December of that year, Sarah Price&nbsp;&mdash; then-Garden curator&nbsp;&mdash; decided to relocate upstate. I took a shot at the position. Even though it had only been a few months, I had fallen in love with the Garden and the world of public horticulture&nbsp;&mdash; that is, gardening for everyone. I could see what a unique and cherished place the Garden held within Central Park and the City itself. <br />&nbsp;<br />I was hired, and 16 years have flown by!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-151228234"" style=""margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;""></div>
<p>
<p><span lang=""EN"">
<p><strong>Tell us about the creative process and planning that goes into designing the Garden's seasonal plantings. What inspires you?</strong></p>
</span>It's great fun to design the Garden's seasonal plantings. I'm fascinated by the forms of plants' flowers, foliage and nuances of color. I plan different displays every year. Once, I repeated a particularly effective design and visitors complained! New Yorkers are a discriminating lot. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the North Garden, for example, I pick tulips in colors that will enhance the Garden's backdrop of deep pink crabapples and the many shades of the neighboring lilacs: a basic palette of pinks, violets, darker purples and blues, creams, even tulips with green streaks. I'll use a minimum of two or three colors and devise a pattern that will read well en masse. That's the tricky part! I've done knots, stripes, chevrons, mixes of up to five different bulbs, you name it! Once I've decided on the design and colors, I'll order those bulbs by the end of July for the following spring bloom. So I'm actually thinking about the 2011 plan now. Then, a week before Thanksgiving, staff and volunteers will put 21,000 tulips in the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p><strong>What about the annual displays?<br /></strong>&nbsp;<br />I typically use about 100 different varieties of annuals in the South Garden displays&nbsp;&mdash; always some new ones, as well as the old, irrefutable standbys.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are five annual beds, color-themed to reflect the beauties of the perennial beds across the paths. The largest bed, for example, is composed of cool tones of blue, purple, and pink. The four smaller beds are predominantly yellow, orange, red, pink, and purple. In all the beds, we use blue and purple flowers to complement the dominant color and burgundy, chartreuse, or silver foliage plants to provide contrast. <br />&nbsp;<br />These plantings also serve as a kind of laboratory for assessing how well they might perform in other places in the Park where we use annuals: the Mall urns, the new Bow Bridge urns, Runner's Gate, etc. I'll be looking forward to some new additions in the perennial beds, such as Blackberry Lily (<em>Belamcanda</em>) and blue Aster 'Jindai', one of Lynden Miller's favorites. In the annual beds, I am trying Angelonia 'Angelface Wedgewood Blue,' a blue and pale yellow bi-color flower, that already looks like a winner, and 'Fireworks' Globe Amaranth (<em>Gomphrena</em>) whose name looks like it might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's very early in the season and time will tell.&nbsp;</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-151230509"" style=""margin-top: 15px; float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>What is the most gratifying part of your job?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />The satisfaction comes from the fact that so many visitors, whether New Yorkers or non-New Yorkers, are so generous with their praise. When they see something they like, they go out of their way to let you know &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s a clean restroom or a beautiful flowering border.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>What question do you get asked most by Garden admirers?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />I'm always asked when is the best time, or my favorite season, to visit the Garden. It's impossible for me to say!<br />&nbsp;<br />Spring in the Conservatory Garden is magnificent &mdash; with the crabapples allees, lilac, tulips and daffodils offering scent as well as color. That could be my favorite season if it weren't for the lushness of bloom we have even in the heat of the summer, or the explosion of multi-hued Korean chrysanthemums in mid-October and November.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />So, once again, I think I've failed to answer the question!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Can you share one of your best horticultural tips for the upcoming summer season?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />I always stress with gardeners that it really pays to pinch back some of the new growth on most annuals and many summer- and fall-blooming perennials early in the season. It promotes branching and additional bloom. Many such plants, just in from the nursery, are ""stretched"" in their growth, because they&rsquo;ve been competing with their tightly-packed neighbors for space and light. The result is often a weak-stemmed plant, which will get top-heavy and flop. Pinching gives the plant another chance at developing lower branching stems and a sturdier base for future bloom, as well as a diversion of energy into the root system. <br />&nbsp;<br />People are understandably nervous about doing this! Believe me, it's a good idea, and done at the right time, won't delay any blooms much, if at all.</p>

<p>The Central Park Conservancy has updated the fountain, originally built in 1917 to celebrate the completion of the Ashokan Reservoir and the dedication of the City's first water tunnel. Instead of using City water, the modernized fountain recirculates water right from the Reservoir. </p>
<p>After the 1917 commemoration, the fountain lay dormant until 1998 when it was repaired to celebrate the City's Water Tunnel No. 3, which crosses underneath the Park at 79th Street. In 2003, the fountain was activated a third time to mark Central Park's 150th anniversary. It has been used only sporadically since then.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Conservancy is pleased to have restored and returned this ornamental element to the Reservoir.

<p>As the heat of summer eases into the crisp of autumn, now is one of the best times of year&nbsp;to grab a blanket and head to&nbsp;Central Park.&nbsp;Of course,&nbsp;the Park's most popular picnic spots&nbsp;are Sheep Meadow and the Great Lawn. At 843 acres, the Park&nbsp;has many great patches of lawn ripe for lounging.</p>
<p>Here, five Central Park Conservancy staff members share their favorite picnic spots in the <br />Park &mdash; spots you might not first think of when you're packing your picnic basket. Just remember: Always properly dispose your trash in the Park's <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/inside-central-park/in-with-the-blue.html"">garbage and recycling bins</a>. Even better? Carry in, carry out!</p>
<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/great-hill-picnic-s.jpg"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;"" />I have to go with the Great Hill. It has several lawn areas that never get too crowded and some lush, large trees. That way, I can get some shade while my wife bakes in the sun. It's also a prime destination for touch football games. All in the same location, I can spend quality time with my wife and participate in my favorite hobby &ndash; competing against other athletes just a tad past their prime. </p>
<p><strong><br />Jamaal King</strong><br />Facility Manager, North Meadow Recreation Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/hernshead-picnic-s.jpg"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;"" /><br />My favorite spot in the park is the Hernshead landscape on the west side of the Lake at 77th Street. The Ladies' Pavilion and the rock outcrop are away from the main path and often feel secluded.&nbsp;The views represent what I love best about the Park: the melding of the natural and the urban world. If you look northeast, you see the beauty of the woodlands of Central Park. If you look south, you see a wonderful view of the Manhattan skyline. It's a lovely spot to have a picnic, read a book or sit and reflect.</p>
<p><strong>Regina Alvarez<br /></strong>Director of Horticulture and Woodland Management</p>
<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/conservatory-picnic-s.jpg"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;"" />My favorite place to picnic is the Conservatory Garden.&nbsp; It's right outside my front door at the Conservancy's 104th Street office. The Garden is always changing&nbsp;&mdash; its colors, its fragrance, its palette of flowers. And there's always plenty of seating, with both shady and sunny areas, depending on your taste. </p>
<p>The El Museo Del Barrio caf&eacute; is right across from the Garden's entrance, and it has a great selection of tasty treats. All you need to do is grab some goodies to go, a friend or a good book, and you have the recipe for a perfect Park picnic.</p>
<p><strong>Kathleen Lessard<br /></strong>Assistant Landscape Architect</p>
<p><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/belvedere-picnic-s.jpg"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;"" />It's hard to choose just one among all the great picnic spots in the Park, but the Turtle Pond landscape is certainly up there for me. Just south of the Great Lawn, it has views of the magnificent Belvedere Castle and Vista Rock in the foreground.</p>

<p>The 10th Annual Film Festival, presented by Bloomberg, kicked off on Tuesday, August 21, with an inspiring Q&amp;A by <em>Do the Right Thing</em> Oscar Nominee Danny Aiello. Danny discussed growing up next to the Park at West 68th Street, how he started acting, and why he sings. The next night, over 4,000 movie-lovers came out to enjoy <em>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</em>. On Thursday, August 23, 7,500 people came to see <em>The Big Lebowski</em>. On Friday night, Delta Tau Chi took over the Park in&nbsp;<em>Animal House</em>. The Festival concluded with the Viewers' Choice Film, <em>Clerks</em>, featuring a Q&amp;A with the film's star, Brian O'Halloran</p>
<p>We asked Film Festival attendees what brought them out to the Festival. Jose from the Bronx said he wanted to take his girlfriend Arjulis on a romantic date (Arjulis says he succeeded). Julia from the Lower East Side came for her son, a Spike Lee fan. Aglaguel from Moroco came to spend a special night with his wife. Asad from the Bronx said <em>Do the Right Thing</em> reminds him of growing up in New York. Perhaps Laurie from Manhattan summed it up best: ""Because how beautiful is this?"" Most visitors said they came out to see great movies outside in Central Park!</p>",Check out the 2012 Central Park Conservancy Film Festival movie listings and details.

<p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><strong>Pumpkin Guidelines<br /></strong><br />1. Get a pumpkin. Purchase a pumpkin between 5 lbs &ndash; 10 lbs. Not sure how big that is? It should look somewhere between the size of a softball and a soccer ball. If your pumpkin weighs less than 5 lbs or more than 10 lbs it will be too light or too heavy for the float devices and cannot be included in the Sail.<br /><br />2. Carve your jack-o&rsquo;-lantern. Pumpkins must be gutted and carved. Any decorations must be made of natural, biodegradable materials. Do not add light bulbs, candles, or floats; a tea light and floating device will be provided when you drop off your jack-o&rsquo;-lantern.<br /><br />3. Drop your jack-o&rsquo;-lantern off on Sunday, October 27 between 3:00 pm and 5:30 pm at the Dana Discovery Center. Jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns will not be returned after the Sail. Space to participate in the sail is limited to 50 floats; pumpkins that do not meet the requirements for participation or are dropped off after 50 floats have been filled will be put on display (space permitting) during the event and will not be included in the Sail.</span></p>

<p>Don't miss the last of the Central Park Conservancy's summer series of chess lectures and simultaneous games on Saturday, September 18. Geared toward the younger set of chess buffs, the event&nbsp;features 16-year-old national master Raven Sturt.</p>
<p>A frequent player at the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan, Sturt will teach his winning techniques to kids from K-12th grades in&nbsp;Central Park at this Chess Lecture/Youth Simul event. The lecture will culminate with an exciting ""simul"" in which Sturt will play as many as 30 opponents at once, moving from board to board, one move at a time. </p>
<p>Held at the Conservancy's Chess &amp; Checkers House (mid-Park at 64th Street), the event runs rain or shine from 10 am to 3 pm. Youth simul sections will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis from 10 am to 10:30 am on the morning of the event. (That includes official ratings of 1,000 or better, under 1,000 and non-rated). </p>
<p>All are welcome to attend the lecture and cheer on the simul participants. Simul spots unclaimed by a participant with the appropriate rating at the close of registration will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis by rated and recreational players of all abilities. If space runs out, the Conservancy's staff will arrange games between players.</p>

<p>The Public Art Fund's newest art installation has been unveiled at the southeast corner of Central Park &mdash; a steel sculpture by artist Eva Rothschild titled ""Empire.""<br />&nbsp;<br />The sculpture is meant to reference the role of the Doris C. Freedman Plaza as one of the most heavily used entrances of the Park. Rising nearly 20 feet over the Plaza, the sculpture takes the form of a multi-directional arched gateway.</p>
<p>""The Plaza is a threshold,"" says Rothschild, one of Great Britain's leading sculptors. ""The work aims&hellip;to heighten awareness of the shift that takes place when one steps out of the street and into the Park. It should become another gateway between two different worlds of urban experience.""</p>
<p>The sculpture will stand on display daily until August 28, 2011 at the Doris C. Freedman Plaza, located at 60th Street at Fifth Avenue. The plaza, named for the founder of the Public Art Fund, has been the site of more than 50 such projects since 1977. </p>",The Public Art Fund's newest art installation has been unveiled at the southeast corner of Central Park.,jklimkiewicz@centralparknyc.org,"Sep 23, 2010 11:07 AM CDT",/visit/inside-central-park/,Default,TRUE,,,cultural-activities,,/assets/images/visit-images/rothschild-l.jpg,/assets/images/visit-images/rothschild-m.jpg,"public art fund, empire, doris freedman plaza, sculpture, art, eva rothschild",,/visit/things-to-see/south-end/doris-c-freedman-plaza.html,,,,/assets/images/visit-images/rothschild-s.jpg,/assets/images/visit-images/rothschild-t.jpg,Flight of the Monarch,flight-of-the-monarch.html,"<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-177968964"" style=""float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p>Some of Central Park's most colorful visitors are making their annual stop to feed on the sweet nectar plants of its gardens and landscapes. <br />&nbsp;<br />Each fall, millions of Monarch butterflies make their way to the remote mountain valleys of south central Mexico. The four-inch, dark orange beauties are one of the few insects that migrate to warmer climates. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Monarchs can be spotted fluttering through the Park along their journey beginning in late summer, particularly in Shakespeare Garden, Conservatory Garden and even Strawberry Fields.</p>
<p>""You can also spot them in the plantings around the Harlem Meer,"" said Regina Alvarez, director of horticulture and woodland management.</p>
<p>Among the Monarchs' favorite plants in Central Park? Brazilian verbena (Verbena bonariensis), Catmint (Nepeta), Mexican sunflower (Tithonia), and Bloodflower (Asclepias curassavica) &mdash; a sweet-smelling nectar and host plant for the butterflies. </p>
<p>Butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberose) and Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) are also big draws. Not only do they provide the nectar the Monarchs need, they're also the only plants the butterflies will lay their eggs on and the only food the Monarch caterpillars eat.</p>

<p>As autumn settles over New York City, Central Park is one of the best places to see fall's foliage. The vibrant colors are expected to peak in the two-week stretch between the end of October and the start of November. From the stand of American Elms that turn the Mall a glorious yellow to the scarlet Pin Oaks of the Ramble, a walk in any nook of the Park won't disappoint.</p>
<p>We asked Neil Calvanese, the Conservancy's vice president for operations, for an insider's view. Here are his picks of some of the best spots to savor the Park in autumn's full color.</p>
<p><strong>Conservatory Water</strong><br />(East Side 72nd to 75th Street)</p>
<p>""This is a lovely area for fall color,"" says Calvanese. Come in through 72nd Street and head toward Conservatory Water for views of vibrant beech, red oak, Norway maple, and red-berried hawthorne trees. Opposite the Kerbs Boathouse you'll find a colorful collection of linden and cherry trees lining the western edge of the water. </p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-179065308"" style=""margin-top: 15px; float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>Harlem Meer</strong><br />(East side from 106th to 110th Street)</p>
<p>With it's shoreline surrounded by oak, beech, gingko, and bald cypress trees, this 11-acre water body will be ablaze with color at the end of October. ""There's such a wonderful variety of trees here, and they really color up beautifully,"" says Calvanese. Circling the Meer, he points to the stand of gingkos at the nearby Bernard Family Playground at East 108th Street. ""They'll turn a beautiful, vibrant yellow that make their uniquely-shaped leaves really stand out.""</p>
<p>For a spectacular fall treat, be sure to stroll up to Fort Clinton, a historic fortification on a high cliff directly south of the Meer. The fort provides a wonderful vantage point across the water. ""In this spot you can come up here and see a whole spectrum of trees,"" says Calvanese. ""It's also a lovely spot to sit and read a book.""</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-179065448"" style=""margin-top: 15px; float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>West 100th Street Pool/Great Hill</strong><br />(West Side from 103rd to 107th Streets)</p>
<p>This area of the Park was dramatically affected by a summer 2009 storm that destroyed more than 500 trees. While some of fall's brightest and best were lost, replanting has begun. Calvanese says this serene nook will still offer up some spectacular color.</p>
<p>Begin at the Pool, strolling down the steps near the West 100th Street entrance. Among the autumn canopy, you'll see the reddish-bronze of European beech trees and the brilliant scarlet of tupelos. The northern shoreline is home to vibrant Pin Oak, hickory and sweet gum trees, as well as bald cypress that Calvanese notes, ""color up to a spectacular russet."" Head north following the connecting path to the Great Hill for more leaf peeping. This is a perfect spot to take in the autumn colors of black cherry, elm, sugar maples and young tupelo trees.</p>
<p>Fall's colors are fleeting. So be sure to make time this season to savor Central Park's best and brightest on your next visit.</p>

<p>As the autumn chill begins to set in, these next few weeks are a gardener's prime time for cleanup and preparation before the cold months ahead. Few know this better than Regina Alvarez, who has 843 lush Central Park acres to wind down for winter as the Conservancy's director of horticulture and woodlands management.</p>
<p>""The season is slowing down and the plants are going dormant,"" says Alvarez. ""This is the time for the gardener to put the garden to bed for the winter.""</p>
<p>A few simple tips from Alvarez will have your garden in top shape once spring comes back around.</p>
<p><strong>Raking and Compost</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Raking is one of the most time-consuming jobs in Central Park, and one of the most important. Be sure to pile the leaves in a place where they can compost through the winter. In the spring, you'll be able to use that organic matter to nourish flowerbeds, helping to improve the fertility and water-holding capacity of the soil.</p>
<p><strong>Cut Back Perennials</strong></p>
<p>This is the time to cut back browning perennials, but be sure to leave plants that provide winter interest: wispy grasses, shapely seed heads like asters, goldenrods and sedums. Cut the stems off near the ground to keep them clean and neat, and prepare them for spring regrowth. </p>
<p>This is also a good time to divide your perennials, and perhaps fill in your garden's blank spots &ndash; or share with your neighbor.</p>
<p>Don't forget to pull out annuals to make room for bulbs and next year's annuals: impatiens, begonias, ageratum and marigolds. Be sure to take cuttings of tender plants such as coleus for propagating next year.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Bulbs</strong></p>
<p>Autumn is the also the time for planting bulbs, trees and shrubs. Daffodils, tulips, crocuses, hyacinths and scillas. Since these plants are going dormant, gardeners will want to be sure to get them planted now so they can develop a good root system and establish themselves before the heat of summer.</p>
<p><strong>Pruning</strong></p>
<p>Hold off just a few more months on pruning shrubs and trees. Winter is actually the best time for this gardening task, since fall pruning can stimulate new growth that will die as soon as the frost arrives.</p>
<p><strong>And Some Final Tips</strong></p>
<p>Once you have your leaves and annuals cleared and your bulbs planted, be sure to use organic matter such as compost and a layer of mulch to act as a protective blanket for the oncoming winter months.</p>
<p>And don't forget the ornamental structures in your garden. With the garden wound down and quiet, this is a great chance to do any repairs you've been meaning to all summer long.</p>","As the autumn chill begins to set in, these next few weeks are prime time for cleanup and preparation before the cold months ahead. ",sbuchanan@centralparknyc.org,"Oct 07, 2010 02:08 PM CDT",/visit/inside-central-park/,Default,TRUE,,,nature-horticulture,,/assets/images/visit-images/conservatory-garden-fall-l.jpg,/assets/images/visit-images/conservatory-garden-fall-m.jpg,"Central Park, New York, parks, recreation, strawberry fields, imagine, john lennon, carousel",,,,,,/assets/images/visit-images/conservatory-garden-fall-s.jpg,/assets/images/visit-images/conservatory-garden-fall-t.jpg,Gathering the Parks Leaves,gathering-the-parks-leaves.html,"<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-181523725"" style=""float: left; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p>Fall's peak foliage has cast a golden palette over Central Park. It's also left a scatter of leaves from the Park's 24,000 trees. ""We're in full leaf-raking mode right now,"" says Russell Fredericks, chief of operations for the Central Park Conservancy. ""And raking will actually continue all the way through New Year's.""</p>
<p>Conservancy staffers fan across the Park's 843-acres daily, working with a dedicated corps of volunteers to gather the mass of leaves. On any given autumn day, Fredericks estimates at least 40 Conservancy staff members are raking, mowing, vacuuming or hauling leaves.</p>
<p>Once they're collected, what happens to all those leaves?</p>
<p>Some actually aren't raked at all. Those in woodland areas such as the Ramble, for example, remain a part of the rustic landscape. Those that fall atop certain lawns are mulch mowed, chopped into tiny bits and deposited back into the turf. </p>
<p>The balance of leaves &ndash; more than 3,000 cubic yards &ndash; are raked or vacuumed, then transported to the Conservancy's composting operation at the Mount, inside the Park at East 102nd Street. There, the leaves are formed into long, narrow piles called windrows. The windrows are routinely turned and aerated to help break down leaves. The rich compost it creates is put to good use year-round in all planting and horticultural projects, essentially blended back into the Park landscape.</p>
<p>""With the trees shedding their leaves and essentially shutting down for the season, our staff is really busy,"" says Fredericks. Yet, he says, this is also a beautiful time to be out in the Park.</p>
<p>""You get to see a different aspect of the trees than during the summer,"" he says. ""As they lose their leaves, they take on a special character. It's really something everyone should get out and see.""</p>

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p><em>The mission of the Central Park Conservancy is to restore, manage, and enhance Central Park in partnership with the public.</em></p>
<p><em>The Conservancy aspires to build a great organization that sets the standard for and spreads the principles of world-class park management &mdash; emphasizing environmental excellence &mdash; to improve the quality of open space for the enjoyment of all.</em></p>
<p><em>The Conservancy is committed to sustaining this operating model to provide a legacy for future generations of park users.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 10.909090995788574px;"">Guiding Principle</h4>
<p>Central Park is a masterpiece of landscape architecture created to provide a scenic retreat from urban life for the enjoyment of all and, in so doing, to establish New York's place among the great cities of the world. As the organization entrusted with the responsibility of caring for New York's most important public space, our work is founded on the belief that citizen leadership and private philanthropy are key to ensuring that the Park and its essential purpose endure.</p>
<!--

<p>The Central Park Conservancy is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1980 that manages Central Park under a contract with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. Thanks to the generosity of many individuals, corporations, foundations, and the City of New York, the Conservancy has invested $690 million to date into the Park, $536 million of which was privately funded, making it a model for urban parks worldwide. The Conservancy provides the majority of Central Park's $58.3 million annual operating budget, and is responsible for all basic care of the Park.</p>
<p>With 40 million visitors each year to its 843 acres, Central Park is the most frequently visited urban park in the United States. To manage the Park, Conservancy crews aerate and seed lawns; rake leaves; prune and fertilize trees; plant shrubs and flowers; maintain ballfields and playgrounds; remove graffiti; conserve monuments, bridges, and buildings; and care for waterbodies and woodlands, controlling erosion, maintaining the drainage system, and protecting over 150 acres of lakes and streams from pollution, siltation, and algae.</p>
<h3>About the Conservancy</h3>
<h4></h4>
<h3>Overview of the Management Contract</h3>
<h4>THE CONTRACT</h4>
<p>Originally signed in February 1998 and renewed in 2006, the City of New York awarded the Central Park Conservancy a management contract to ensure the continuing maintenance, public programming, and capital restoration of Central Park. This contract affirms the City's confidence in its more than thirty year partnership with the Conservancy. The Conservancy has invested nearly $650 million in Central Park operations, capital improvements, programs for visitors and volunteers. Under this agreement, the Conservancy receives an annual fee for services. The amount of the fee is determined by a formula from the City that requires the Conservancy to raise and spend a specified minimum amount of private funds in the Park on an annual basis.</p>
<h4>REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTRACT</h4>
<p>Under this renewed eight-year agreement, the Conservancy provides for the Park's day-to-day care. Specified in the contract are: landscape maintenance, replacement of dead trees and plants, mowing and reseeding/resodding, graffiti removal, cleaning playgrounds and comfort stations, clearing walkways; cleaning drains, sewers, and walkways; repairing benches, and maintaining and repairing structures and monuments. The Conservancy's responsibilities also include providing public programs to educate visitors about the Park's assets.</p>
<h4>THE CITY OF NEW YORK'S ROLE IN CENTRAL PARK

</h4>
<p>The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. Capital improvements in the Park continue to undergo public review at each stage of development, with advice and consent from the Commissioner of Parks & Recreation. In addition, the City of New York/ Parks & Recreation continues to have discretion over all events in the Park.</p>
<h4>The CONSERVANCY'S QUALIFICATIONS</h4>
<p>The Central Park Conservancy is uniquely qualified to manage Central Park. Since 1980, the Conservancy has restored and managed the Park with its partner, the City of New York. The Conservancy brought the Park back from its deteriorated state in the 1960s and 1970s to its present condition by restoring and maintaining major landscapes and historic structures. The Conservancy is a model for public-private partnerships for parks throughout the country and has developed an accomplished staff of park management professionals.</p>
<p>The Conservancy also has an impressive track record in raising private funds to improve and preserve Central Park. The Conservancy has invested more than $650 million in private dollars, which, combined with the City's investment, has turned Central Park into a living symbol of New York City's revitalization.</p>
<h4>THE CONSERVANCY'S GOVERNANCE</h4>
<p>The Conservancy is accountable to the City of New York. The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. The Commissioner and officials of the City of New York/Parks & Recreation are involved in all Park planning and must approve all of the Conservancy's capital improvements in the Park. The Conservancy, however, as a private not-for-profit organization, has a separate Board of Trustees. The Board is comprised of 43 general trustees representing the community that uses the Park, four ex officio trustees including the Parks Commissioner, the Borough President of Manhattan, the Central Park Administrator, and the president of the Women's Committee, and five Trustees appointed by the Mayor of the City of New York. Additionally, there are currently 13 Life Trustees.</p>

accomplished singer; he is a prince, originating from one of the most 
famous families of royal Griots, the &ldquo;Bour Guewels&rdquo; of Senegal, West 
Africa. His music celebrates this cultural and artistic heritage. When 
Mor turned 35 years old, he moved from Senegal to Harlem, New York to 
pursue an international performing arts career, and has met great 
success performing with his band at venues near and far, including the 
Apollo Theater and Cathedral of Saint John the Divine as well as venues 
all over the States.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;""><strong>a.&nbsp;Organizational Status</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">The Central Park Conservancy is a publicly-supported tax exempt 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">b.&nbsp;Mission</span></strong></p>
<p>The mission of the Central Park Conservancy is to restore, manage, and enhance Central Park in partnership with the public.</p>
<p>The Conservancy aspires to build a great organization that sets the standard for and spreads the principles of world-class park management &mdash; emphasizing environmental excellence &mdash; to improve the quality of open space for the enjoyment of all.</p>
<p>The Conservancy is committed to sustaining this operating model to provide a legacy for future generations of park users.</p>
<p>The Central Park Conservancy is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1980 that manages Central Park under a contract with the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. Thanks to the generosity of many individuals, corporations, foundations, and the City of New York, the Conservancy has invested $690 million to date into the Park, $536 million of which was privately funded, making it a model for urban parks worldwide. The Conservancy provides the majority of Central Park's $58.3 million annual operating budget, and is responsible for all basic care of the Park.</p>
<p>With 40 million visitors each year to its 843 acres, Central Park is the most frequently visited urban park in the United States. To manage the Park, Conservancy crews aerate and seed lawns; rake leaves; prune and fertilize trees; plant shrubs and flowers; maintain ballfields and playgrounds; remove graffiti; conserve monuments, bridges, and buildings; and care for waterbodies and woodlands, controlling erosion, maintaining the drainage system, and protecting over 150 acres of lakes and streams from pollution, siltation, and algae.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">c.&nbsp;Guiding Principle</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Central Park is a masterpiece of landscape architecture created to provide a scenic retreat from urban life for the enjoyment of all and, in so doing, establishes New York&rsquo;s place among the great cities of the world. As the organization entrusted with the responsibility of caring for New York's most important public space, our work is founded on the belief that citizen leadership and private philanthropy are key to ensuring that the Park and its essential purpose endure.</span></p>

<p>Dog Gone It! Did you join us for the 11th Annual <strong>My Dog Loves Central Park Fair</strong>?</p>
<p>It was another great day for dogs in Central Park. On October 5, 2013, thousands of New Yorkers and their dogs celebrated the Park and its outstanding dog community. There were games and dancing (with your dog), storytelling and dog patting, agility tryouts and CGC testing. There were training tips and microchipping &mdash; and much more.</p>
<p>Thanks to our loyal sponsors: Banfield Pet Hospital, Biscuits &amp; Bath, Freshpet, and PetSmart. And to the outstanding team of CPC staff and volunteers. Everyone worked together to make this a great day.</p>
<p>Save the date! The next My Dog Loves Central Park Fair is October 11, 2014, 11:00 am &ndash; 3:00 pm at the Bandshell (mid-Park at 72nd Street). We hope to see you, and your dog, there!</p>

<h2>COMPLETED: The Fort Landscape</h2>

<p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Summer through Fall 2013</p>

<p><strong>Site History:</strong><br/>

The landscape just south of the Harlem Meer has a rich pre-Park history. During the Revolutionary War, the British built military fortifications on the bluffs overlooking Harlem. These were rebuilt by Americans during the War of 1812, but never used. 
These were incorporated into the Park when its northern boundary was extended to 110th Street. By the late 1920s, the landscape had become overgrown and deteriorated and there were few remaining traces of the fortifications. In 1934, the area was fenced off and designated a bird sanctuary. In the 1940s, as part of a project to reconstruct the landscapes around the Meer, paths were added to the Fort Landscape and along the south shore of the Meer. The existing overlooks at Fort Clinton and Nutter&rsquo;s Batter were also built at this time. Since then, the landscape has deteriorated and there are problems with poor drainage, erosion, deteriorating pathways, and inadequate irrigation infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Project Details:</strong><br/> 

This project is one of the last phases of the larger project to restore the landscapes on the east side of the Park, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Harlem Meer. The work includes rebuilding paths and stairs; reconstructing and upgrading storm drainage infrastructure and irrigation systems; restoring lawn and enhancing landscape plantings; and replacing site amenities including benches and lighting.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Reconstruction of the Landscape West and North of the Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>
<p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> February 2013 to Fall 2013</p>
<p><strong>Project Details:</strong> This project consists of a comprehensive reconstruction of the landscape directly adjacent to the west and north sides of the MET. The work consists of rebuilding drainage and irrigation infrastructure and park paths; landscape restoration, including amending the soil, establishing lawn, and installing new plantings; and the installation of new site furnishings including lights, fences, benches, and drinking fountains.</p>

<br/>

<h2>COMPLETED: Conservation of William Tecumseh Sherman</h2>

<p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> June 2013 to October 2013</p>

<p><strong>Monument Info:</strong><br/>
The William Tecumseh Sherman monument by Augustus Saint-Gaudens is widely regarded as one of the artist&rsquo;s greatest public works and one of the most important equestrian statues in the country. The monument depicts a winged figure of the goddess Victory, leading General Sherman on his horse Ontario. The equestrian group is gilded bronze, supported by a pink granite base, designed by Charles Follen McKim of the architectural firm McKim, Mead & White. The monument was installed in 1903 in the center of a traffic circle at the southeast corner of Central Park. The area was henceforth known as Grand Army Plaza. In 1921 the monument was moved sixteen feet to the west and incorporated into the expansion of the Plaza based on a design by the architecture firm Carr&egrave;re and Hasting.</p>

<p><strong>Project Details:</strong>
This project aims to address the current condition of the Sherman monument through a comprehensive conservation treatment. The work includes repointing the monument base; removing the existing coatings; evaluating, cleaning, and conserving the bronze; regilding and toning the monument; and applying protective coatings.</p>

<br/>

<h2>COMPLETED: Tots Playground</h2>
<p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> January 2013 through Summer 2013</p>
<p><strong>Project Details:</strong> This comprehensive reconstruction of Tots Playground aims to enhance the playground&rsquo;s relationship with the Park and the adjacent Adventure Playground. In response to the small size of the space and current use patterns, it also aims to improve the play experience for the youngest playground users.</p>
<p>The work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifying the footprint of the playground from a rectilinear to a circular shape, to better blend with the surrounding landscape.</li>
<li>Providing new play equipment and features including swings, a water feature, a sand area, and contoured landforms. The playground will be bound by a low seat wall; beyond a low fence will weave through plantings.</li>
<li>Rebuilding storm drainage and water supply infrastructure.</li>
<li>Supplementing existing planting surrounding the playground.</li>
<li>Rebuilding surrounding Park paths to be accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Site History:</strong> The playground known as Tots Playground was constructed in 1956, the last playground created during the administration of Robert Moses. It was a result of a highly publicized conflict between upper west side neighborhood parents and the administration of the Parks Department known as the ""Battle of Central Park.""</p>
<p>In 1956, Robert Moses planned to construct a new parking lot for Tavern on The Green to the north of the entrance drive at 67th Street, on a well-shaded, grassy area adjacent to one of the marginal playgrounds. The landscape slated for the parking lot was well-used by mothers and their children in the neighborhood, as a place to gather, picnic, and run around on the grass. Mothers described it as ""an unofficial playground"" and would often sit on the benches along the outside of the playground fence, from which they could keep an eye on children playing both inside the playground and in the landscape.</p>
<p>When the mothers discovered the plans, they quickly launched a protest to prevent the project from going forward. They contacted the press and local politicians and staged a protest at the site where a bulldozer had already mobilized. Despite a substantial amount of negative press, Moses pushed forward with the project and in a clandestine effort, directed the first round of construction to take place at night. The mothers awoke to find a portion of the landscape razed and numerous trees removed. They intensified their protest, hiring a lawyer who managed to convince a judge to put a temporary stop to the work, in part by arguing that the expansion of Tavern on the Green was a serious encroachment on the Park. After a few months of stalling, the Parks Department decided not to risk going to trial and the potential for additional negative publicity and cancelled the project. With the landscape already significantly altered, the Parks Department decided to offer what it considered a concession to those who had opposed the parking lot: they would create a new playground on the site.</p>
<p>The resulting playground was somewhat typical of other Moses-era playgrounds. It included standard play equipment such as swings, a slide, and a small jungle gym. It was about one-third of the size of the typical playground, however, and its rectilinear form&mdash;determined by the plans for the proposed parking lot&mdash;contrasted with the ovoid footprints of the typical perimeter playgrounds. To accommodate the playground, new paths were added and existing paths reconfigured, including the relocation of a section of the Bridle Path to the east.</p>
<p>The playground has been rebuilt twice. In 1968 it was rebuilt based on a design by Dattner who had redesigned the adjacent playground as ""Adventure Playground"" in 1966. It was intended as a complement to that playground, with smaller scale play features intended for younger children. In 1987, the Conservancy renovated the playground, installing new post-and-platform play equipment, a sandbox, safety surfacing, and drainage infrastructure. The swings from the existing playground were retained, along with the benches which lined the perimeter of the playground. The program of use was also maintained and the playground was designed for use by pre-school age children.</p>

<h2><strong>COMPLETED: The East 110th Street Playground at the Harlem Meer</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Fall 2012 through Summer 2013</p>
<p><strong>Project details:</strong> The project includes a complete reconstruction of the East 110th Street Playground and improvements to enhance and restore the surrounding landscape, aiming to better integrate playground with the Park. This represents the first full reconstruction of the playground since 1979.</p>
<p>The project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reconstruct the playground as a series of distinct play spaces connected by a winding boardwalk. Play spaces will include a new and expanded water feature, a large wooden climber and both strap swings and bucket swings.</li>
<li>Incorporate an area without equipment inside the playground, for safe unstructured play.</li>
<li>Add new plantings inside and surrounding the playground and a low discrete playground fence, to help better integrate the playground with the Park.</li>
<li>Restore the landscape surrounding the playground, including rebuilding the path along the Meer, rebuilding infrastructure, restoring lawn areas and adding new plantings.</li>
<li>Expand the shoreline across from the playground, adding boulders and plantings, and created stepped access to the water&rsquo;s edge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Site History:</strong> The site of the Harlem Meer was added to the Park in 1860, when the original boundary at 106th Street was extended to 110th Street. The low-lying swamp in the northeast corner of the expanded park site was drained to create the Meer, a naturalistic lake surrounded by a planted landscape on its north side and rocky bluffs on its south side. A boathouse was built in 1930, and the first playground on the site was constructed in 1936 as part of Robert Moses's original perimeter playground system. Over the rest of the 20th century, the area was increasingly urbanized: in the 1940s, the Parks Department built a larger boathouse, a concrete edge around the shoreline and a steel picket fence separating the paths, water and lawns. The playground, as well as the Meer, experienced a period of decline and neglect like the rest of the Park. The playground's reconstruction in 1979 was a small improvement in a blighted landscape until the Conservancy began a dramatic restoration of the Harlem Meer in the late 1980s, including the building of the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center in the early 1990s. In 1996, the Conservancy also partially renovated the playground but retained most elements of the 1979 construction.</p>",The Conservancy is continually undertaking restoration projects to repair and improve the Park's facilities and user experiences.,bbell@centralparknyc.org,"Nov 18, 2011 12:39 PM CST",/about/planning-design-construction/,Default,TRUE,,,none,,,,"Central Park, New York, parks, recreation, restoration, capital, improvement, update, repair",,,,,,,,Giving Thanks,giving-thanks.html,"<p>Just like so many of you, we at the Central Park Conservancy are taking the time to pause and reflect on all that we have to be thankful for. The list is long; in our 30 years of caring for the Park, we've been able to count on so many generous friends and supporters to help us in our mission. As we think back on the past year's challenges and successes, we'd like to give thanks to all those who have been so <strong>central to the Park</strong>. Here's a highlight of all that we have to be thankful for &ndash; with our gratitude equal for each one.</p>
<p><strong></strong>1.<strong> Conservancy Staff </strong></p>
<p>2011 dealt Central Park a blizzard, a <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/about/news/central-park-news/hurricane-cleanup-in-central.html"">hurricane</a> and a <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/about/news/central-park-news/halloween-storm-damage.html"">destructive Halloween snowstorm</a> that claimed nearly 1,000 trees. Our staff stepped up to the challenge every time, working hard to clean and recover from the damage &ndash; and ensure that visitors could use the Park. Their talent and dedication is behind every flowerbed, landscape and monument you see in the Park. <strong></strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Volunteers</strong></p>
<p>If Central Park is the heart of New York City, then <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/volunteer/"">volunteers</a> are the heart of the Conservancy. In 2011, 2,000 individual volunteers lent us a hand by raking, painting, planting and mulching. All told, they donated over 40,000 hours of their time to keep Central Park clean and beautiful.</p>
<p>3.<strong> Supporters</strong></p>
<p>Many people have the misconception that tax dollars pay for Central Park's upkeep. In fact, the Conservancy actually raises 85% of the cost to maintain New York City's great green space. We wouldn't be able to do it without the continued support of <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/donate/"">Conservancy members and donors</a>. They're contributions are truly central the Park. <strong></strong></p>
<p>4. <strong>Conservancy Partners</strong></p>
<p>With nearly 38 million visitors each year, Central Park is many things to many people. Our partners &ndash; <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/visit/central-park-paws/"">Central Park Paws</a>, <a href=""http://nyrr.org/"" target=""_blank"">New York Road Runners</a>, and the Central Park <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/donate/more-ways-to-give/playground-partners.html"">Playground Partners</a> among them &ndash; keep us connected to the Park's various user groups. They are the eyes and ears of the Park, and we're thankful that we can rely on them to get the word out about responsible Park use. <strong></strong></p>
<p>5.<strong> Facebook Friends and ""Tweeps""</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, we've loved staying in touch with Central Park fans and Conservancy supporters through <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/centralparknyc"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/#%21/CentralParkBuzz"">Twitter</a>.&nbsp; We look forward to the Park photos and stories they share with us every day, and their kind words, kudos and thanks gives our staff a boost.&nbsp; We're grateful for the dialogue they help create about the Park we all love, and for helping us get the word out about the Conservancy and our mission to maintain and preserve Central Park.</p>

The Conservancy values and respects its donors&rsquo; right to privacy, and is committed to ensuring that donors&rsquo; personal information is used only for the purposes for which is it collected, and in accordance with donors&rsquo; intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donors&rsquo; personal information is collected to establish and manage the Conservancy&rsquo;s relationship with donors, and to identify donors&rsquo; preferences and expectations.&nbsp; The information is also used by the Conservancy to analyze giving patterns, process gifts, and provide donors with documentation of their charitable contributions.&nbsp; In addition, personal information is used to publicly recognize and thank donors for their generosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conservancy only uses and discloses personal information with donor permission.&nbsp; Donors who wish to avoid any disclosure of their contributions may inform the Conservancy when making a pledge or gift.&nbsp; This request for anonymity shall be honored by the Conservancy unless, and until, a donor informs the Conservancy otherwise.&nbsp; In the absence of a donor&rsquo;s request for anonymity, the Conservancy may, at its discretion, recognize and publicize a donor&rsquo;s contribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Gift Acknowledgement and Recognition</strong></p>
<p>The Conservancy recognizes donors&rsquo; philanthropic contributions by various means, in a tasteful and appropriate manner, respecting the desire of those donors who wish remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Gifts accepted by the Conservancy, regardless of value or form, shall be acknowledged in writing to the donor, and in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and US Income Tax Regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership gifts of a certain magnitude towards particular projects or campaigns may receive in-Park recognition for a specified term of years, or in perpetuity, agreed upon, on a case-by-case basis and in writing, and subject to any required consents and/or approvals from the NYC Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, applicable community boards, the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, the NYC Art Commission, and such other consents and/or approvals as may be required by law.&nbsp; Determination of the required gift level for in-Park donor recognition, if any, shall be made on a case-by-case basis by the Conservancy, taking into account such factors as the financial needs of the Park and the philanthropic climate at the time of the contribution.</p>
<p>The Conservancy may, at its discretion or at the request of the City of New York, relocate or remove in-Park donor recognition at the end of the agreed upon term, or when the renovation of the surrounding area warrants such a change.&nbsp; In addition, in the event that circumstances change substantially such that continued in-Park donor recognition could compromise the public&rsquo;s trust, the Conservancy, may relocate or remove such in-Park donor recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donors who wish to avoid any public recognition of their contributions may inform the Conservancy when making a pledge or gift.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transparency of Conservancy Resource Allocation and Fiduciaries</strong></p>
<p>The Conservancy recognizes that donors must be assured that their contributions will be used prudently and in accordance with the intent for which they were given.&nbsp; Information regarding the manner and purposes in which the Conservancy&rsquo;s resources are allocated shall be made readily available to donors through disclosure of the Conservancy&rsquo;s most recent financial statements and IRS Form 990.&nbsp; In addition, the identity of the Conservancy&rsquo;s fiduciaries, its governing board and its senior management, shall also be disclosed to donors.&nbsp; The Conservancy&rsquo;s Annual Report, IRS Form 990, as well as a list of its Senior Management and Board of Trustees can be found on the Conservancy&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Review and Amendment of the Donor Relations Policy</strong></p>
<p>The Gift Acceptance Committee of the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to review and recommend modifications to the Donor Relations&nbsp;Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 16, the New York Philharmonic performed Tchaikovsky's <i>Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35</i>, Wagner's Prelude to Act I of <i>Die Meistersinger</i>, and Brahms' <i>Symphony No. 1</i> in Central Park. Starting at 8:00 pm, attendees enjoyed classical music in the Park's iconic Great Lawn; for days in advance, the Central Park Conservancy worked to make the Lawn fit for tens of thousands of music lovers and&nbsp;a massive stage.</p>
<p>Since 1980, the Central Park Conservancy has worked to&nbsp;maintain, manage and restore Central Park for the enjoyment of millions of visitors. We've also been the unofficial roadies of events in the Park, helping to set up and break down equipment for performances by some of the world's most accomplished artists.</p>
<p>That work doesn't usually take center stage &mdash; the music does. But photographer Emon Hassan helped to document the extraordinary efforts that go into preparing the Park for the New York Philharmonic's summer concerts in Central Park, giving you an insider's look at the work that lets the music happen.</p>
<p>The work began on July 13 at 6:00 am, and we didn't&nbsp;rest until the Philharmonic's first performance later that night. After clean-up of the Great Lawn (which lasted until the early hours of July 14) we prepared the landscape for its usual flood of weekend visitors. On Monday, July 16, we were back at work to ready the landscape for a second show.</p>
<p>This photo documentary shows the work surrounding the second and final concert in Central Park. With up to 200,000 visitors exploring the Park's 843 acres every day, the Conservancy feels as if almost every day is a major event in Central Park. But these concerts and our role in preparation of them is something special. Enjoy!</p>

<p>On July 16, the New York Philharmonic performed Lyadov's <em>Polonaise in Memory of A.S. Pushkin</em>, Tchaikovsky's <em>Violin Concerto</em>, and Brahms' Symphony No. 1<em> </em>in Central Park. Starting at 8:00 PM, attendees enjoyed classical music in the Park's iconic Great Lawn; for days in advance, the Central Park Conservancy worked to make the Lawn fit for tens of thousands of music lovers and&nbsp;a massive stage.</p>
<p>Since 1980, the Central Park Conservancy has worked to&nbsp;maintain, manage, and restore Central Park for the enjoyment of millions of visitors. We've also been the unofficial roadies of events in the Park, helping to set up and break down equipment for performances by some of the world's most accomplished artists.</p>
<p>That work doesn't usually take center stage - the music does. But photographer Emon Hassan helped to document the extraordinary efforts that go into preparing the Park for the New York Philharmonic's summer concerts in Central Park, giving you an insider's look at the work that lets the music happen.</p>
<p>The work began on July 13 at 6:00 AM, and we didn't take a rest until the Philharmonic's first performance later than night. After clean-up of the Great Lawn (which lasted until the early hours of July 14) we prepared the Great Lawn for its usual flood of weekend visitors; on Monday, July 16, we were back at work to ready the landscape for a second show.</p>
<p>This photo documentary shows the work surrounding the second and final concert in Central Park. With up to 200,000 visitors exploring the Park's 843 acres every day, the Conservancy feels as if almost every day is a major event in Central Park. But these concerts and our role in preparation of them is something special. Enjoy!</p>
<p><i><a href=""http://emonhassanphotography.com"" target=""_blank"">Emon Hassan</a> is a New York based filmmaker and photographer. Born in Dhaka, Bangladesh, he has had the great privilege of living in four continents.

<p>On July 16, the New York Philharmonic performed Tchaikovsky's <i>Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35</i>, Wagner's Prelude to Act I of <i>Die Meistersinger</i>, and Brahms' <i>Symphony No. 1</i> in Central Park. Starting at 8:00 pm, attendees enjoyed classical music in the Park's iconic Great Lawn; for days in advance, the Central Park Conservancy worked to make the lawn fit for tens of thousands of music lovers and&nbsp;a massive stage.</p>
<p>Since 1980, the Central Park Conservancy has worked to&nbsp;maintain, manage and restore Central Park for the enjoyment of millions of visitors. We've also been the unofficial roadies of events in the Park, helping to set up and break down equipment for performances by some of the world's most accomplished artists.</p>
<p>That work doesn't usually take center stage &mdash; the music does. But photographer Emon Hassan helped to document the extraordinary efforts that go into preparing the Park for the New York Philharmonic's summer concerts in Central Park, giving you an insider's look at the work that lets the music happen.</p>
<p>The work began on July 13 at 6:00 am, and we didn't&nbsp;rest until the Philharmonic's first performance later that night. After clean-up of the Great Lawn (which lasted until the early hours of July 14) we prepared the landscape for its usual flood of weekend visitors. On Monday, July 16, we were back at work to ready the landscape for a second show.</p>
<p>This photo documentary shows the work surrounding the second and final concert in Central Park. With up to 200,000 visitors exploring the Park's 843 acres every day, the Conservancy feels as if almost every day is a major event in Central Park. But these concerts and our role in preparation of them is something special. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Explore some of the Park's most exceptional and beloved landscapes on the Conservancy's new Tree Discovery Walks. Wander at your own pace through three scenic routes, selected and mapped by the Conservancy's Park experts, and expand your knowledge of the Park's trees along the way. See the Park as the experts do: a rich landscape where every tree and shrub has a unique name and identity.</p>
<p>The three walks have been selected to maximize arboreal diversity along routes that offer more than just trees. Visitors will also be guided through some of the Park's most celebrated destinations, including Strawberry Fields, Bethesda Fountain, Conservatory Water and the Great Lawn. The three walks are the <strong>East Side Zofnass Walk</strong>, located between 85th and 60th Streets on the Park's east side; the <strong>Great Lawn Walk</strong>, running east-to-west between 79th and 81st Streets; and the <strong>Bethesda Walk</strong>, running east-to-west at 72nd Street. The walks feature a combined total of 125 unique tree and shrub species.</p>

<p align=""center""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Largest Gift to Public Parks to Sustain New York&rsquo;s Central Park as</strong></span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Premier Public Space and Cultural Institution</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Today, John A. Paulson and the Paulson Family Foundation announced a gift of $100 million to the Central Park Conservancy to sustain the fundamental role of Central Park as one of New York City&rsquo;s leading cultural institutions and the world&rsquo;s most extraordinary public park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Paulson&rsquo;s donation is the largest gift ever made to the Central Park Conservancy. It is also the largest gift to any public park and one of the largest ever made to a New York City cultural institution. It will sustain and advance the innovation of the Conservancy&rsquo;s management and maintenance practices and allow for improvements to park-wide infrastructure, Central Park&rsquo;s 21 playgrounds, 130 acres of woodlands, five visitor centers, and youth and family programming and recreation facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conservancy&rsquo;s management practices will be sustained and developed as a model for public-private partnerships locally and worldwide. Already, the Conservancy&rsquo;s model has influenced the management of public spaces such as Prospect Park, Brooklyn Bridge Park and Battery Park in New York City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Paulson&rsquo;s gift comes at a time of unprecedented use of Central Park: with more than 40 million annual visitors, Central Park is visited by more people than any other New York City cultural institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Central Park was created by two individuals &mdash; Olmsted and Vaux &mdash; in 1858. In 1980, a group of individuals banded together to restore it to its long-forgotten glory,"" said <strong>Doug Blonsky, President and CEO of the Central Park Conservancy. </strong>""Today, John joins these visionaries to sustain Central Park well into the future. This has always been a park designed for and sustained by the people - a celebration of the people's right to relax, reflect and celebrate. John shares that vision, and thanks to him Central Park's purpose will endure.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great privilege to be able to contribute to the Central Park Conservancy, one of the most important cultural institutions in New York,&rdquo; said <strong>Mr. Paulson. </strong>&ldquo;The Conservancy is responsible for transforming and sustaining Central Park as the celebration of culture, nature and democracy that it is today. It is my hope that today&rsquo;s contribution will help it endure and flourish and inspire others to join me in ensuring that the Park continues to receive the support it needs to be this city&rsquo;s greatest asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Over the past 33 years, the Central Park Conservancy has led the world's most significant public park into the longest period of sustained health in its history,"" said <strong>Thomas L. Kempner, Jr., Chairman of the Central Park Conservancy's Board of Trustees. </strong>""John's gift helps ensure that its excellence endures for generations to come and acknowledges its importance to the cultural and economic health of New York City.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This generous gift will ensure that the park remains as Frederick Olmsted and Calvert Vaux envisioned it a century and a half ago: a peaceful oasis right in the middle of the busiest city in the world, and a community gathering place that is experienced by all New Yorkers on equal grounds, regardless of background or walk of life,&rdquo; said <strong>Mayor Bloomberg</strong>. &ldquo;Central Park has an enormous economic impact on our city &ndash; 40 million annual visitors generating $1 billion in economic activity &ndash; and that&rsquo;s in large part due to the great work of the Central Park Conservancy, the Parks Department and the New York City Police Department, who have worked together since 1980 to restore Central Park to its glory and take it to new heights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;During the past 30 years, Central Park has been transformed into the work of art envisioned by Olmsted and Vaux, thanks to the City&rsquo;s partnership with the Central Park Conservancy,&rdquo; said <strong>Parks &amp; Recreation Commissioner Veronica M. White.</strong>&nbsp; &ldquo;This exceptionally generous donation from John A. Paulson will help ensure that Central Park flourishes for years to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1980, the Central Park Conservancy has managed the investment of nearly $700 million into Central Park, almost $550 million of which was raised by the Conservancy from hundreds of thousands of individuals, corporations and foundations for the Park&rsquo;s restoration and maintenance. The Conservancy is responsible for the physical management of the Park along with its funding, privately fundraising more than 80 percent of Central Park&rsquo;s $45.8 million annual budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 153 years, Central Park has been the people&rsquo;s park. Thanks to the vision and generosity of benefactors like John Paulson, Central Park&rsquo;s future as the park New York City needs and deserves is secure.</p>

In the 1970s and early 1980s, it was in serious disrepair &mdash; its infrastructure was crumbling, its landscapes were in shambles and it was plagued with drugs and crime.&nbsp; Thanks to an extremely successful partnership that began in 1980 between the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy, Central Park has been magnificently restored. From Bethesda Fountain to Sheep Meadow, from the Harlem Meer to the Promenade, from Strawberry Fields to the Conservatory Gardens, the metamorphosis has been extraordinary. Today over 40 million people visit a year, up 200% since the Conservancy took over.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">&ldquo;We have many people to thank for this transformation and the continued maintenance and improvements, including the co-founders Betsy Rogers and Gordon Davis, current President Douglas Blonsky, the Conservancy Board of Trustees, the 374 full and part-time Conservancy staff who care for the Park every day, City Hall and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Parks Commissioner Veronica White and the 35,000 Central Park Conservancy members.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">&ldquo;People may ask why make such a gift to Central Park today. There are several reasons:</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-left: .25in; mso-add-space: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">1.<span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">First, in contrast to what many people think, although Central Park is a public park, 85% of the operating budget for Central Park is funded by the Central Park Conservancy, a private organization. The operation of Central Park requires contributions from the private sector. A portion of today&rsquo;s gift will go to the permanent endowment of the Central Park Conservancy to ensure it has the operating funds to pay for its upkeep.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: .25in; mso-add-space: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">2.<span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Secondly, while Central Park is probably in the best shape it has ever been, more work needs to be done. Fifty percent of today&rsquo;s gift will go to fund needed capital improvements to restore, rejuvenate, and enhance additional areas of Central Park. Two important projects include the restoration of the North Woods &mdash; an unbelievable area filled with trees, streams, waterfalls, bridges, fields and scenic walkways that has been hidden from New York for decades, and the landscaping surrounding Merchant&rsquo;s Gate in the Southwest corner of Central Park. That landscape is home to the Park&rsquo;s most visited entrance and should reflect the beauty and quality of the Park&rsquo;s entire 843 acres. Also included are refurbishment of playgrounds, capital projects in the Conservatory Garden, Tennis House Landscaping, continued improvement of the Ramble, bathroom restoration improvements and many other projects, large and small.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: .25in; mso-add-space: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">3.<span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Thirdly, of all of New York City&rsquo;s great cultural institutions, I believe Central Park is the most democratic. It&rsquo;s open to people of all ages, income levels, race, religion and nationality. It&rsquo;s open every day and all day. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions of New Yorkers every year. And it is free. A contribution to Central Park Conservancy benefits all New Yorkers.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: .25in; mso-add-space: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">4.<span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]--><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Lastly, I must admit there is also a bit of selfishness. I enjoy Central Park almost every day, particularly walking, cycling, and running through the Park. My<a name=""_GoBack""></a> children enjoy the carousel, the zoo, the row boats, and the playgrounds. I&rsquo;m continually amazed at the incredible beauty of the Park and in awe of the work and talent of the Conservancy. And, I&rsquo;m excited at the improvements that this gift will help make. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I wish this gift could meet all the capital and operating needs of the Park but it cannot. It&rsquo;s a big space and there is a lot to do. I hope many of you will join me in helping to fund the operating expenses of the Park by becoming Central Park Conservancy members and for those that have the ability, to join me in helping fund capital improvements in the Park.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d also like to make a gift to everyone here of a book by Sara Cedar Miller entitled <em>Central Park: An American Masterpiece</em>. This is a beautiful book that fully captures the essence of Central Park in both its photos and its writings.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">&ldquo;I want to close with a quote from Olmsted and Vaux, the architects of the Park, written 150 years ago: &lsquo;The primary purpose of the Park is to provide the best practicable means of healthful recreation for the inhabitants of the city, of all classes. It should have an aspect of spaciousness and tranquility, with variety of intricacy and arrangement, thereby affording the most agreeable contrast to the confinement, bustle and monotonous street division of the city&hellip;The Park is intended to furnish healthful recreation for the poor and the rich, the young and the old, the vicious and the virtuous, so far as each can partake therein without infringing on the rights of others, and no further.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">&ldquo;If they were living today, I think they would be thrilled that their 150-year-old creation is alive and well, every bit and more as the day it was created. It is my hope that today&rsquo;s gift will ensure that all of us will be enjoying Central Park for many more years to come.&rdquo;</span></p>

			<h1>Why Attend?</h1>
			<p>Believe it or not, only 15 percent of households in buildings near the Park are current donors to the Conservancy. 
That's why on this one special evening we 
are encouraging our friends in Park perimeter buildings to simultaneously celebrate the Central Park Conservancy and help increase support (to at least 50 percent) among our neighbors.</p>
			<p>With a current annual budget of $45.8 million required for the Conservancy to care for the Park's 843 acres &ndash; 85 percent of which we must raise from private sources &ndash; our continued success in maintaining this historic, green treasure will depend upon galvanizing those who benefit from the Park every day.</p>
			<p>Want to help support your Park? Join your friends and neighbors in raising funds and awareness on behalf of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>

			<p>Together they celebrated spring and enjoyed a spectacular fireworks display in Central Park, while garnering support for the Central Park Conservancy.</p>
<p>You can be central to the Park by joining fellow residents and neighbors as a host in spring 2015. Take a look at the map below to see residences and corporate locations of our Ambassador hosts!</p>

			<h1>Why Host?</h1>
			<p>The Conservancy has set a goal to increase the percentage of current supporters in buildings near the Park. 
That's why on this one special evening we 
are encouraging our friends and neighbors in Park perimeter buildings to simultaneously celebrate spring in Central Park and help increase support of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>
			<p>With a current annual budget of $58.3 million required for the Conservancy to care for the Park's 843 acres &ndash; the majority of which we must raise from private sources &ndash; our continued success in maintaining this historic, green treasure will depend upon galvanizing those who benefit from the Park every day.</p>
			<p>Want to help support your Park? Join your friends and neighbors in raising funds and awareness on behalf of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>

Enjoy dinner and dancing under a clear-ceiling tent in the Park, with a beautiful nighttime view of the tree canopy and stars up above. Over five hundred guests are expected to come out in celebration of New York City&rsquo;s most treasured green space. Most importantly, the event will raise vital funds that benefit the Conservancy's mission to restore and maintain the Park.</p>

</p>
<p>1.1. Governing Agreement
    <br/>The terms of this agreement (""Terms of Service"" or &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern the relationship between you and the Central Park Conservancy, Inc. (hereinafter ""CPC"" or ""Us"" or ""We"") regarding your use of CPC&rsquo;s social games and related services,
    which include applications for mobile devices and CPC branded websites (the ""Service""). In this agreement, ""CPC"" means the Central Park Conservancy located at 14 East 60th Street, New York, New York, 10022.</p>
<p>1.2. Privacy Policy
    <br/>Use of the Service is also governed by CPC's Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. Your privacy is important to Us. We designed CPC's Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how We collect and use your content and information
    and how you can use the Service to share such information with others. We encourage you to read the CPC Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions. By creating an account or accessing or using the Service you accept and agree to be
    bound by these Terms of Service and consent to the collection, use and storage of your information as outlined in CPC&rsquo;s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>1.3. Updates to the Terms of Service and CPC Privacy Policy
    <br/>CPC reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service and its Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Terms on or within the Service. You may also be given additional notice, such as
    an e-mail message or messaging within the Service, of any changes. You will be deemed to have accepted such changes by continuing to use the Service. Except as otherwise stated, all amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are
    initially posted. CPC may also revise other policies, codes or rules at any time, and the new versions will be available at www.centralparknyc.org or in the Service. No amendment to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of
    which CPC had actual notice before the date of the amendment.</p>
<p>This agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing hand signed by you and Us. For purposes of this provision, ""writing"" does not include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an electronic signature. If at any point you do not
    agree to any portion of the then-current version of our Terms of Service, the CPC Privacy Policy, or any other CPC policy, rules or codes of conduct relating to your use of the Service, your license to use the Service shall immediately terminate and you

<p><strong>3. DONATION TERMS</strong>

    </br>3.1. Donations</br>In the Service you may purchase, via a donation to CPC, and with ""real world"" money, a license to use Virtual Items and or other goods or services. DONATIONS TO ACQUIRE A LICENSE TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.</br>You can
    license Virtual Items by visiting the donation page in one of our games, providing your billing information, confirming the particulars of your purchase and re-affirming your agreement to these Terms. When you purchase, via a donation to CPC, a license
    to Virtual Items from our Service, We may send you a confirmatory e-mail that will contain details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmatory e-mail are correct as soon as possible and maintain a copy of it for your
    records. CPC keeps records of transactions in order to deal with any subsequent queries. If you purchase Facebook Credits from Facebook, you are agreeing to Facebook&rsquo;s Payment Terms and CPC is not a party to the transaction.</br>For Virtual Items,
    your order will represent an offer to us to purchase a license for the relevant service(s) which will be accepted by us when We make the Virtual Items available in your account for you to use in our games or debit your credit card, whichever comes first.</br>Your
    license to Virtual Items for use in CPC games is a service provided by CPC that commences upon acceptance by CPC of your purchase or redemption of third party virtual currency. By ordering a license to use Virtual Items you agree and accept that CPC will
    provide it to you promptly following completion of your purchase. If you reside in the European Union and you purchase a product or service from CPC, you may have the right to withdraw from a purchase within seven calendar days, commencing on the day
    after the date of purchase (the ""Cooling Off Period""). However, you lose your right of withdrawal if the performance of the services begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Accordingly, please note that if you purchase a license to use Virtual
    Items from Us, your right of withdrawal is lost as the performance of our services begins promptly once your purchase is completed.</p>
<p>3.2. Payment</br>You agree to pay all amounts incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. CPC may revise the pricing for the goods and services it licenses to you through the Service at any time. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CPC IS NOT REQUIRED
    TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>

<div  style=""color:#484848; font-size:14px; text-align:justify;"">
<p>The Central Park Conservancy is always developing innovative ways to improve your experience in the Park. We're launching a new trash management system that will reduce rats, result in fewer vehicles on paths, and increase recycling. Here's how:</p>

<div style=""padding-left:50px; padding-right:80px;"">
<ul>
<li>Strategic removal and relocation of cans, resulting in fewer rats in Central Park.</li>
<li>This strategic placement of fewer can locations means fewer pickup vehicles on paths, and a safer Park for children and pets.</li>
<li>Installation of more recycling cans, leading to a projected 30 percent increase in recycling in the Park.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<center><img src=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/assets/images/visit-images/Alcoa-Infographic-Final.jpg"" style=""padding:15 0 15 0;""></center>

<p>The Conservancy is introducing 700 newly designed trash and recycling cans to the Park. Made from partially recycled aluminum donated by Alcoa Inc., these cans are more durable than the plastic ones you're used to and their one-of-a-kind design was  inspired by the slats of the Park's iconic benches! This new trash strategy was made possible by the Alcoa Foundation, which generously donated $500,000 toward its development, and Landor Associates, who custom-designed the new trash cans. </p>

<p>Visitors like you will be our most important partners in making this new plan a success. With your help, the Park will be cleaner and more sustainable than ever.</p>

			<h1>Why Attend?</h1>
			<p>Believe it or not, only 15 percent of households in buildings near the Park are current donors to the Conservancy. 
That's why on this one special evening we 
are encouraging our friends in Park perimeter buildings to simultaneously celebrate the Central Park Conservancy and help increase support (to at least 50 percent) among our neighbors.</p>
			<p>With a current annual budget of $45.8 million required for the Conservancy to care for the Park's 843 acres &ndash; 85 percent of which we must raise from private sources &ndash; our continued success in maintaining this historic, green treasure will depend upon galvanizing those who benefit from the Park every day.</p>
			<p>Want to help support your Park? Join your friends and neighbors in raising funds and awareness on behalf of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Blonsky&rsquo;s leadership, the Conservancy has completed such noteworthy restoration projects as the Great Lawn, the Harlem Meer, the Merchants&rsquo; Gate, the Mall, the Conservatory Water, the Pond, the Pool, and the Reservoir fence. He has developed several innovative Park management and preservation practices, which have set the standard for park management nationwide. The zone management system, for example, divides Central Park into 49 zones, each with a dedicated gardener who provides a uniformed presence and is held accountable for his or her zone. This system creates accountability for cleanliness and productivity improvements throughout the Park. In addition, Mr. Blonsky developed and implemented a program to train and mentor NYC Parks Department gardeners from underserved parks in all five boroughs (Neighborhood Parks Initiative). These individuals are trained by Conservancy staff in Central Park in horticulture, maintenance, and management.</p>

<p>During his tenure, Mr. Blonsky has also managed the operational logistics of some of the largest events in the Park, including The Gates; September 11th first anniversary remembrance; New York City Marathon; annual performances by the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera; concerts by Garth Brooks, Sheryl Crow, Sting, and Dave Matthews; the premiere of Disney&rsquo;s Pocahontas; and a Mass given by Pope John Paul II.</p>

<p>A graduate of the University of Delaware and Cook College at Rutgers University, Mr. Blonsky holds Bachelor of Science degrees in both Plant Science and Landscape Architecture, and is a registered landscape architect in New York State.</p>

","Chief Financial Officer &amp; Vice President for Finance and Administration
",rlynn@centralparknyc.org,"Nov 06, 2009 09:49 AM CST",/about/inside-the-conservancy/management-board/,Default,TRUE,,,none,,,,"Stephen, Spinelli, financial, administrator, officer, leadership",,,,,,,,Copy of About the Central Park Conservancy,inside-cpc-1.html,"<p><strong>A Public/Private Partnership</strong><br />In 1998, the City of New York awarded the Central Park Conservancy a management contract that ensured the continuing maintenance, public programming, and capital restoration of Central Park. This contract confirmed the City's confidence in its nearly twenty-year partnership with the Conservancy. Both the Conservancy and the City of New York had invested nearly $350 million in Central Park operations, capital improvements, programs for visitors and volunteers, and endowment; it also had played an increasingly active role in Park management.</p>
<p>Under this agreement, the Conservancy receives an annual fee for services. The amount of the fee was determined by a formula that requires the Conservancy to raise and spend a specified minimum amount of private funds in the Park on an annual basis. The minimum Conservancy annual expenditure &mdash; which can include maintenance, programming and landscape improvements &mdash; is $5 million. The annual fee from the City depends on the Conservancy's expenditures in the Park and on the revenues generated by concessions in Central Park.</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-441552229"" style=""float: right; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 15px;""></div>
<p>On April 27, 2006, the contract was renewed for another eight years. The new contract maintains the City's baseline allocation for the maintenance of the Park, but it lifts the cap on the amount of funding the Conservancy receives based on concession revenues generated in the Park. Under the previous contract, the Conservancy received an amount equal to 50% of concession revenues beyond the first $6 million generated in the Park, not to exceed $2 million. As more of the Park is restored and the cost of caring for it continues to grow, removing this cap will ensure that the Park will continue to benefit from increasing revenues that are directly related to its successful management.</p>
<p>Under the current&nbsp;eight-year agreement, the Conservancy will provide for the Park's day-to-day care. Specified in the contract are: landscape maintenance, replacement of dead trees and plants, mowing and reseeding/resodding, graffiti removal, cleaning playgrounds and comfort stations, clearing walkways; cleaning drains, sewers, and walkways; repairing benches, and maintaining and repairing structures and monuments. The Conservancy's responsibilities also include providing public programs to educate visitors about the Park's built and natural assets. Over the term of its partnership with the City, the Conservancy has expanded its activities to include all of the above activities; the management contract ratifies those activities.</p>
<p><strong>The City of New York's Role in Central Park<br /></strong>The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. Capital improvements in the Park will continue to undergo public review at each stage of development with advice and consent from the Commissioner of Parks &amp; Recreation. The City of New York/ Parks &amp; Recreation has discretion over all events in the Park, and that will continue. At present, all revenues generated from concessions in the Park go into the City of New York's general fund, and that will continue.</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-441552230"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>The Conservancy's Qualifications</strong><br />The Central Park Conservancy is uniquely qualified to manage Central Park. The Conservancy has a proven track record in restoring and managing the Park. With its partner, the City of New York, it brought the Park from its deteriorated state in the late 1970s to its present condition, with major landscapes and historic structures restored and well-maintained. The Conservancy is a model for public-private partnerships for parks throughout the country and has developed an excellent staff of park management professionals.</p>
<p>The Conservancy also has a track record in raising private funds to improve and preserve Central Park. Since its founding in 1980, the Conservancy has raised $350 million in private dollars, which, combined with the City's investment, turned Central Park into a living symbol of New York City's revitalization. Further, of every $1 the Conservancy raises, more than $.80 goes toward direct spending on horticulture, operations, maintenance, education, recreation, and public programs.</p>
<div class=""templateComponent"" id=""image-441552231"" style=""float: right; margin-left: 15px;""></div>
<p><strong>The Conservancy's Governance<br /></strong>The Conservancy is and will be accountable to the City of New York. The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. The Commissioner and officials of the City of New York/Parks &amp; Recreation Department are involved in all Park planning and must approve all of the Conservancy's capital improvements in the Park. In addition, the Conservancy's 52-member Board of Trustees includes the Parks Commissioner and the Borough President of Manhattan (both ex officio), five Trustees appointed by the Mayor of the City of New York, and private sector members representing the City's business and philanthropic communities.&nbsp;See the&nbsp;""<a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/about/inside-the-conservancy/governance-overview.html"">Governance Overview</a>"" page for more information.</p>
<p><strong>The Conservancy's Community Outreach and Public Review Process<br /></strong>Central Park will always be a public park. The Conservancy will continue to involve the public in the planning of any improvements to the Park. Starting with approval by the Commissioner of Parks &amp; Recreation, the Conservancy's community outreach on capital projects is one of the most extensive and inclusive in the City. For any project, the Conservancy consults with Park users and surrounding communities to help develop its plans. The Conservancy then presents its plans to Community Boards, the Landmarks Preservation and Art Commissions for their review and approval. This process will continue unaltered.</p>
<p>Advisory boards comprised of community residents work with the Conservancy on a range of projects and issues. They include the following, and will be expanded as projects and programs create the need: The Upper Park Community Advisory Committee, the Woodlands Advisory Board, the Great Lawn Advisory Committee, the Central Park Recreation Roundtable, the North Meadow Recreation Center Advisory Committee, the Public Programs Community Advisory Committee, and the Frederick Douglass Circle Community Advisory Committee.</p>","In 1998, the City of New York awarded the Central Park Conservancy a management contract that ensured the continuing maintenance, public programming, and capital restoration of Central Park.

<p>The Perimeter Association provides funding for the improvement and maintenance of Central Park's six-mile perimeter which runs from the Park's wall to the street curb.&nbsp;Over 100 residential buildings, clubs, and community organizations around the Park support the program with contributions from $1,500 to $7,000. Contributions to the Perimeter Association allow Conservancy staff to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the six-mile perimeter clean seven days a week, year-round</li>
<li>Remove snow, leaves and graffiti</li>
<li>Pick up trash and other debris</li>
<li>Power wash and sweep sidewalks</li>
<li>Install plantings along the wall and at entrances</li>
<li>Repair Park walls, sidewalk and benches</li>
</ul>

<p style=""font-size: 11px; margin-top: -10px;"">The Hampshire House, situated at 150 Central Park South between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, has been a symbol of elegant New York-living since its doors opened in 1938. The 36 story building was designed by A. Rollin Caughey and William F. Evans, Jr. and features interiors by Dorothy Draper. Regency and Art Deco styles come to life in the building&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade, from the gleaming white brick base to the signature pyramidal copper roof. In addition to amenities including a luxury health club and spa, residents enjoy close proximity to the finest theaters, restaurants, shopping destinations, museums, and of course, Central Park.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 11px;"">The Hampshire House has been a generous supporter of the Central Park Conservancy for many years. In 2012, shareholders were presented with the Conservancy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Central to the Park&rdquo; award in recognition of their partnership with the organization. Through contributions to the Perimeter Association, the Hampshire House helps ensure that their residents&rsquo; front yard echoes the beauty of the building they call home. The Women&rsquo;s Committee of The Central Park Conservancy extends its sincere appreciation to the Board of Directors of the Hampshire House for their continued and loyal support.</p>

<p>The Adopt-A-Bench program was established in 1986 as a permanent fund to maintain and endow the care of Central Park's more than 9,000 benches and their surrounding landscapes. To date, more than 3,000 benches have been adopted. In recognition of contributions to the fund, the Conservancy installs a personalized plaque on a park bench of the donor's choosing. Most benches can be adopted for $7,500. Custom-made rustic benches can be adopted for $25,000 and placed in a woodland or rustic area of the Park.</p>

<p>A bench is a wonderful way to memorialize or honor a loved one. Adopt-A-Bench for a birthday, anniversary, new baby, graduation &ndash; it is the perfect gift for any occasion! While the plaques take about 8 weeks for production and installation, a personalized certificate can be provided immediately upon adoption to notify the recipient that a bench has been adopted in their honor. You can write the plaque inscription yourself or let the recipient write their own. For more information on how you can select and personalize your bench, please call <strong> 212-310-6617</strong>.</p>

The Tree Trust of the Central Park Conservancy offers you the unique opportunity to support the care of Central Park&rsquo;s 22,000 trees. All contributions to the Tree Trust are placed in an endowment for existing trees and to fund the planting of new trees. Your gift will help ensure that Central Park&rsquo;s trees are well-maintained.</p>

<p>For important milestones in your life, endow a tree and create a living memory that will last for generations to come. Many donors choose to make a contribution as a gift in honor or in memory of someone, or to celebrate a joyous occasion.</p>

<p>
With the endowment of a tree, the gift is honored with an engraved paving stone at the southern end of Literary Walk in the heart of Central Park.

<p>The mission of Central Park Playground Partners is to maintain the quality and cleanliness of Central Park&rsquo;s 21 playgrounds. Our playgrounds embody the highest standards of safety, innovation, and creativity, but these standards cannot be sustained without donations like yours. <a href=""https://secure2.convio.net/cpc/site/Donation2?df_id=1300&amp;1300.donation=form1"">Being a Playground Partner</a> is a wonderful way to directly engage in your community of families and neighbors. We seek to promote stewardship and environmentalism throughout the Park, bringing unique opportunities for camaraderie and friendship for you and your children. The funds we receive go directly towards the preservation, care, and daily inspection of these cherished play spaces. With your generosity, our Playgrounds can continue to enrich the quality of life for present and future generations of children and be an essential part of a healthy childhood for all families living in New York City.</p>
<p>The Playground Partners of the Women&rsquo;s Committee of the Central Park Conservancy, hosts its Annual Family Party at Heckscher Playground, inside the Park at Central Park South and 7th Avenue the third Wednesday of May. The event is a family-friendly fundraiser with activities geared toward children six months to 10 years of age.</p>
<p>PGP TOTS is a subcommittee of the Playground Partners specifically for moms with children under three years old. PGP TOTS offers moms the opportunity to network, share resources, and discover all that Central Park has to offer its youngest visitors through informal gatherings such as play dates, stroller walks, and informational lectures.</p>

<p>The Perimeter Association provides funding for the improvement and maintenance of Central Park's six-mile perimeter which runs from the Park's wall to the street curb.&nbsp;Over 100 residential buildings, clubs, and community organizations around the Park support the program with contributions from $1,500 to $7,000. Contributions to the Perimeter Association allow Conservancy staff to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the six-mile perimeter clean seven days a week, year-round</li>
<li>Remove snow, leaves and graffiti</li>
<li>Pick up trash and other debris</li>
<li>Power wash and sweep sidewalks</li>
<li>Install plantings along the wall and at entrances</li>
<li>Repair Park walls, sidewalk and benches</li>
</ul>

<p>Without the support of the Perimeter Association's cooperating buildings, it would be difficult to keep the perimeter clean and maintained.</p>

<p>The map below indicates those buildings that have contributed to the Perimeter Association during the 2014 fiscal year (donations made between July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A special thank you to The Beresford (211 Central Park West) and the Rudin Management Company for their loyal and generous support.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""font-size: 11px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 145%; "">Some of the most recognizable icons of Central Park aren't inside the Park &mdash; they're the buildings that surround it. One of these landmark neighbors is the Beresford, located between 81st and 82nd Streets on Central Park West.</p>
 
<p style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 145%; "">""The Beresford is clearly meant to be seen from Central Park,"" said architecture critic Paul Goldberger. Though it may appear to be square, the Beresford is shaped like a U, with the U's right side at 82nd Street. Ornate, baroque towers sit atop three of the building's four corners, all except the northwest corner, which faces away from the Park. The best view of the building looks toward the southeast corner, as one does from the Lake in Central Park. The Beresford's three towers suggest a V shape that forms an arrow pointing directly toward Bethesda Terrace, the heart of Central Park. </p>

<p style=""font-size: 11px;  line-height: 145%; "">In the Beresford, architect Emery Roth brought together a variety of styles, including Art Deco, Beaux-Arts, and baroque. Goldberger calls the Beresford an ""interpretation of Italian architecture and other styles"" that simultaneously fulfills the demands of a large New York City apartment building. ""Roth was an assembler of various architectural elements,"" Goldberger said. In the Beresford, these various styles, ""form eclectic, free-flowing mixes."" The result is a building that is distinctly Emery Roth and distinctly New York.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 11px;  line-height: 145%; "">The Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy sincerely appreciates The Beresford's ongoing, loyal support of the Perimeter Association.</p>

<h1 class=""greentitle2"">BioBlitz Results Show a Very Diverse Central Park</h1>

<p style=""line-height:130%;"">The initial results of the Central Park BioBlitz are in! They indicate that the Conservancy's long-time management has encouraged greater wildlife diversity throughout Central Park.</p>

<p style=""line-height:130%;"">The BioBlitz was an intensive 24-hour survey of the Park conducted in summer 2013. Here are a few of the most exciting BioBlitz discoveries:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>The eastern chipmunk was identified in Central Park for the first time in many years. Experts attribute its resurgence to the Conservancy's 2009 removal of trash cans from the Park&rsquo;s woodlands, which took away an important food source from the competing, non-native rat population. When the rats left the woodlands, the chipmunks returned.</li>
<li>The bullhead catfish and black crappie were identified in Central Park's ponds for the first time. Dr. John Waldman, who led fish identification throughout the Park, said that the quality of the Park's water bodies were similar to those found in upstate, remote areas thanks to the Conservancy's Soil & Water Lab, which is dedicated to the care of the Park's lakes.</li>
<li>A multitude of insects were identified for the first time, particularly in the Hallett Nature Sanctuary and other woodlands. In these areas, Conservancy crews are more likely to allow fallen limbs and trees to remain on the ground, creating a habitat for native insects. Insects feed the Park&rsquo;s large bird population and are a healthy part of any ecosystem.</li>
<li>Many lichens were observed in the north end of the Park, but we were surprised to find nearly as many in the south end, which receives 75 percent of the Park's 40 million annual visitors. In addition, researchers found lichens on almost every tree in the Park, compared to the 1970s when nearly no lichens were present. Experts attributed this to the improved air quality in Central Park, thanks to the cultivation of trees and plant life.</li></ul></p>


<p style=""line-height:130%;"">The Central Park BioBlitz was organized by the Central Park Conservancy and Macaulay Honors College. From August 26 to August 27, more than 500 Macaulay sophomores and scientists from leading research institutions surveyed Central Park for 24 hours, identifying as many species as possible.</p>

<p style=""line-height:130%;"">The complete results will be shared next spring in a series of public programs to teach you more about the Park and its wildlife.

			<h1>Why Attend?</h1>
			<p>Believe it or not, only 15 percent of households in buildings near the Park are current donors to the Conservancy. 
That's why on this one special evening we 
are encouraging our friends in Park perimeter buildings to simultaneously celebrate the Central Park Conservancy and help increase support (to at least 50 percent) among our neighbors.</p>
			<p>With a current annual budget of $58.3 million required for the Conservancy to care for the Park's 843 acres &ndash; the majority of which we must raise from private sources &ndash; our continued success in maintaining this historic, green treasure will depend upon galvanizing those who benefit from the Park every day.</p>
			<p>Want to help support your Park? Join your friends and neighbors in raising funds and awareness on behalf of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>

			<h1>Why Host?</h1>
			<p>The Conservancy has set a goal to increase the percentage of current supporters in buildings near the Park. 
That's why on this one special evening we 
are encouraging our friends and neighbors in Park perimeter buildings to simultaneously celebrate spring in Central Park and help increase support of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>
			<p>With a current annual budget of $58.3 million required for the Conservancy to care for the Park's 843 acres &ndash; the majority of which we must raise from private sources &ndash; our continued success in maintaining this historic, green treasure will depend upon galvanizing those who benefit from the Park every day.</p>
			<p>Want to help support your Park? Join your friends and neighbors in raising funds and awareness on behalf of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>

<p>Central Park Conservancy, a private, not-for-profit organization, was formed in 1980 by a group of concerned citizens determined to improve Central Park. Today, we manage Central Park under a contract with the City of New York. Over its 160-year history, the Park has experienced a cycle of improvements and decline. The latest decline was in the 1960s and 70s, which led to Central Park Conservancy's formation. Central Park Conservancy is uniquely qualified to break this cycle, to prevent future declines, and to ensure the Park's care for current and future generations.</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of many individuals, corporations, foundations, and the City of New York, Central Park Conservancy has invested nearly $700 million to date into the Park, making it a model for urban parks worldwide. We provide 75% of Central Park's $58.3 million annual operating budget, and we are responsible for all basic care of the Park.</p>
<p>With 40 million visits each year to its 843 acres, Central Park is the most frequently visited urban park in the United States. To manage the Park, Conservancy crews aerate and seed lawns; rake leaves; prune and fertilize trees; plant shrubs and flowers; maintain ballfields and playgrounds; remove graffiti; conserve monuments, bridges, and buildings; and care for waterbodies and woodlands, controlling erosion, maintaining the drainage system, and protecting over 150 acres of lakes and streams from pollution, siltation, and algae.</p>
<p>Learn about Central Park Conservancy's <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/2014/about/about-cpc/management-board/"">management and Board of Trustees</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Central Park Conservancy is to restore, manage, and enhance Central Park in partnership with the public.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy aspires to build a great organization that sets the standard for and spreads the principles of world-class park management &mdash; emphasizing environmental excellence &mdash; to improve the quality of open space for the enjoyment of all.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy is committed to sustaining this operating model to provide a legacy for future generations of park users.</p>
<p><a href=""#"" onclick=""cambiar('background'); return false;""> <span class=""xs-icon glyphicon glyphicon-play""></span>&nbsp;<strong>Guiding Principle</strong></a></p>
<div id=""background"" style=""display: none;"">
<p>Central Park is a masterpiece of landscape architecture created to provide a scenic retreat from urban life for the enjoyment of all and, in so doing, to establish New York's place among the great cities of the world. As the organization entrusted with the responsibility of caring for New York's most important public space, our work is founded on the belief that citizen leadership and private philanthropy are key to ensuring that the Park and its essential purpose endure.</p>
</div>
<p><a href=""#"" onclick=""cambiar('background2'); return false;""> <span class=""xs-icon glyphicon glyphicon-play""></span>&nbsp;<strong>Our Contract with the City of New York</strong></a></p>
<div id=""background2"" style=""display: none;"">
<p>In 2013, the City of New York awarded Central Park Conservancy a new management agreement to ensure the continued maintenance of Central Park. Originally signed in 1998 and renewed in 2006, the 2013 contract affirms the City's confidence in its more than thirty-three year partnership with Central Park Conservancy.</p>
<p>Under the current ten-year agreement, Central Park Conservancy provides for the Park's day-to-day care, as well as certain maintenance work outside Central Park. Specified in the contract are: landscape and lawn maintenance, tree care, horticultural work, graffiti removal, cleaning playgrounds and comfort stations, repairing benches, clearing walkways, cleaning drains and sewers, and maintaining and repairing monuments and certain Park structures.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy receives an annual fee for the services it provides. The amount of this fee is determined using a formula that requires Central Park Conservancy to raise and spend a specified minimum amount of private funds in the Park on an annual basis. Since 1980, Central Park Conservancy has invested nearly $700 million in Central Park operations, capital improvements, and programs for visitors and volunteers.</p>

<div id=""background3"" style=""display: none;"">
<p>The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. Capital improvements in the Park continue to undergo public review at each stage of development, with advice and consent from the Commissioner of Parks &amp; Recreation. In addition, the City of New York and Parks &amp; Recreation continues to have discretion over all events in the Park.</p>
</div>
<p><a href=""#"" onclick=""cambiar('background4'); return false;""> <span class=""xs-icon glyphicon glyphicon-play""></span>&nbsp;<strong>Central Park Conservancy's Governance</strong></a></p>
<div id=""background4"" style=""display: none;"">
<p>Central Park Conservancy is accountable to the City of New York. The City of New York retains control and policy responsibility for Central Park. The Commissioner and officials of the City of New York/Parks &amp; Recreation are involved in all Park planning and must approve all of Central Park Conservancy's capital improvements in the Park. Central Park Conservancy, however, as a private not-for-profit organization, has a separate Board of Trustees.

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;THE ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;Organizational Status</strong></p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy is a publicly-supported tax exempt 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;Mission</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Central Park Conservancy is to restore, manage, and enhance Central Park in partnership with the public.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy aspires to build a great organization that sets the standard for and spreads the principles of world-class park management &mdash; emphasizing environmental excellence &mdash; to improve the quality of open space for the enjoyment of all.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy is committed to sustaining this operating model to provide a legacy for future generations of park users.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy is a private, not-for-profit organization founded in 1980 that manages Central Park under a contract with the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. Thanks to the generosity of many individuals, corporations, foundations, and the City of New York, Central Park Conservancy has invested $700 million to date into the Park, $536 million of which was privately funded, making it a model for urban parks worldwide. Central Park Conservancy provides the majority of Central Park's $58.3 million annual operating budget, and is responsible for all basic care of the Park.</p>
<p>With 40 million visits each year to its 843 acres, Central Park is the most frequently visited urban park in the United States. To manage the Park, Conservancy crews aerate and seed lawns; rake leaves; prune and fertilize trees; plant shrubs and flowers; maintain ballfields and playgrounds; remove graffiti; conserve monuments, bridges, and buildings; and care for waterbodies and woodlands, controlling erosion, maintaining the drainage system, and protecting over 150 acres of lakes and streams from pollution, siltation, and algae.</p>
<p><strong>c.&nbsp;Guiding Principle</strong></p>
<p>Central Park is a masterpiece of landscape architecture created to provide a scenic retreat from urban life for the enjoyment of all and, in so doing, establishes New York&rsquo;s place among the great cities of the world. As the organization entrusted with the responsibility of caring for New York's most important public space, our work is founded on the belief that citizen leadership and private philanthropy are key to ensuring that the Park and its essential purpose endure.</p>
<p><strong>d.&nbsp;Core Values</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commitment:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value commitment to our mission, Central Park, and the visitor experience.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value innovation and the highest quality results in every aspect of our work.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value ethical conduct in our business practices.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptability:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value adaptability in our response to change and challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;We value clear, consistent communication, teamwork and an open dialogue both internally and with the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Public Confidence:</strong>&nbsp;We value the public, and work to earn and maintain their confidence in our role as caretakers of Central Park.</p>

<p>This Donor Relations Policy aims to clarify Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s policies and procedures regarding recognition of gifts, donor privacy, and honoring donor intent.&nbsp; Central Park Conservancy, through this policy, strives to adhere to the principles set forth by the Donor Bill of Rights created by the Association of Fund Raising Professionals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality of Personal Information of Donors</strong></p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy and its employees are responsible for maintaining records of all personal information of donors.&nbsp; Every reasonable precaution shall be taken to protect and preserve the confidentiality of such personal information.&nbsp; Conservancy employees and volunteers, as well as agents and authorized service providers of Central Park Conservancy, are required to safeguard donors&rsquo; personal information. Central Park Conservancy values and respects its donors&rsquo; right to privacy, and is committed to ensuring that donors&rsquo; personal information is used only for the purposes for which is it collected, and in accordance with donors&rsquo; intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donors&rsquo; personal information is collected to establish and manage Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s relationship with donors, and to identify donors&rsquo; preferences and expectations.&nbsp; The information is also used by Central Park Conservancy to analyze giving patterns, process gifts, and provide donors with documentation of their charitable contributions.&nbsp; In addition, personal information is used to publicly recognize and thank donors for their generosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy only uses and discloses personal information with donor permission.&nbsp; Donors who wish to avoid any disclosure of their contributions may inform Central Park Conservancy when making a pledge or gift.&nbsp; This request for anonymity shall be honored by Central Park Conservancy unless, and until, a donor informs Central Park Conservancy otherwise.&nbsp; In the absence of a donor&rsquo;s request for anonymity, Central Park Conservancy may, at its discretion, recognize and publicize a donor&rsquo;s contribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Gift Acknowledgement and Recognition</strong></p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy recognizes donors&rsquo; philanthropic contributions by various means, in a tasteful and appropriate manner, respecting the desire of those donors who wish remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Gifts accepted by Central Park Conservancy, regardless of value or form, shall be acknowledged in writing to the donor, and in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and US Income Tax Regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership gifts of a certain magnitude towards particular projects or campaigns may receive in-Park recognition for a specified term of years, or in perpetuity, agreed upon, on a case-by-case basis and in writing, and subject to any required consents and/or approvals from the NYC Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, applicable community boards, the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission, the NYC Public Design Commission, and such other consents and/or approvals as may be required by law.&nbsp; Determination of the required gift level for in-Park donor recognition, if any, shall be made on a case-by-case basis by Central Park Conservancy, taking into account such factors as the financial needs of the Park and the philanthropic climate at the time of the contribution.</p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy may, at its discretion or at the request of the City of New York, relocate or remove in-Park donor recognition at the end of the agreed upon term, or when the renovation of the surrounding area warrants such a change.&nbsp; In addition, in the event that circumstances change substantially such that continued in-Park donor recognition could compromise the public&rsquo;s trust, Central Park Conservancy, may relocate or remove such in-Park donor recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donors who wish to avoid any public recognition of their contributions may inform Central Park Conservancy when making a pledge or gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Transparency of Conservancy Resource Allocation and Fiduciaries</strong></p>
<p>Central Park Conservancy recognizes that donors must be assured that their contributions will be used prudently and in accordance with the intent for which they were given.&nbsp; Information regarding the manner and purposes in which Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s resources are allocated shall be made readily available to donors through disclosure of Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s most recent financial statements and IRS Form 990.&nbsp; In addition, the identity of Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s fiduciaries, its governing board and its senior management, shall also be disclosed to donors.&nbsp; Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s Annual Report, IRS Form 990, as well as a list of its Senior Management and Board of Trustees can be found on Central Park Conservancy&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Review and Amendment of the Donor Relations Policy</strong></p>
<p>The Gift Acceptance Committee of the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to review and recommend modifications to the Donor Relations&nbsp;Policy.</p>

To date, more than 3,000 benches have been adopted. In recognition of contributions to the fund, Central Park Conservancy installs a personalized plaque on a park bench of the donor's choosing. Most benches can be adopted for $7,500. Custom-made rustic benches can be adopted for $25,000 and placed in a woodland or rustic area of the Park.<br /><br />A bench is a wonderful way to memorialize or honor a loved one. Adopt-A-Bench for a birthday, anniversary, new baby, graduation &ndash; it is the perfect gift for any occasion! While the plaques take about 8 weeks for production and installation, a personalized certificate can be provided immediately upon adoption to notify the recipient that a bench has been adopted in their honor.

The funds we receive go directly towards the preservation, care, and daily inspection of these cherished play spaces.

<p>Central Park, the first major landscaped public space in urban America, was created in the 1850s as an antidote to the turbulent social unrest, largely as the result of the country's first wave of immigration, and a serious public health crisis, caused by harmful environmental conditions. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the winners of the 1858 design competition for Central Park, along with other socially conscious reformers understood that the creation of a great public park would improve public health and contribute greatly to the formation of a civil society. Immediately, the success of Central Park fostered the urban park movement, one of the great hallmarks of democracy of nineteenth century America.</p>
<p>By the early twentieth century, vicissitudes of the social, political and economic climate threatened the fabric of the Park and caused its first serious decline. Robert Moses, park commissioner from 1934 to 1960, received federal funding for the restoration of many eroded landscapes and crumbling structures, and embarked on massive public programming for the post-Depression populace. When he left office, however, there was no management strategy for maintaining those improvements or educating Park visitors in proper stewardship, and for the next two decades the second &mdash; and most devastating&mdash; decline took its toll on the fragile 843-acre Park. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Physically the Park was in a chronic state of decay. Meadows had become barren dustbowls; benches, lights, and playground equipment were broken, and the one-hundred-year-old infrastructure was crumbling. Socially, the Park bred a careless, even abusive attitude towards the Park evidenced by unchecked amounts of garbage, graffiti, and vandalism. Positive use had increasingly been displaced by illicit and illegal activity. The perception &mdash; and in many cases, the reality&mdash; of Central Park was of a lawless and dangerous ruin. Despite a workforce of over three hundred Parks Department employees assigned to Central Park, there was no accountability. New York City had abdicated their responsibility as Park stewards and, as a result, this national treasure became a national disgrace.</p>
<p>To help remedy this troubled situation, George Soros and Richard Gilder, under the aegis of the Central Park Community Fund, underwrote a management study of Central Park in 1974 by E.S. Savas, who was at that time the Columbia University School of Business, Professor of Public Systems Management. The groundbreaking study proposed that two important initiatives be implemented to ameliorate the conditions in Central Park: one, that a Chief Executive Officer be given ""clear and unambiguous managerial authority"" for all Park operations, and two, a Central Park Board of Guardians be created to oversee strategic planning and policy, thereby instituting private citizen involvement in their public park.</p>
<p>The study's first proposal resulted in the appointment in 1979 of Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Barlow (now Rogers), a Yale-educated urban planner and writer, who became the newly created Central Park administrator, charged with overseeing all aspects of the Park's daily operations, in essence the Chief Executive Officer recommended in the Savas study. For four years before her appointment, Betsy had been overseeing the Central Park Task Force's program for summer youth interns, eventually becoming the head of that small, private organization, financially separate from the City but existing under the aegis of the Parks Department.</p>
<p>Given her new official status and responsibilities as administrator, Betsy first conceived of and then helped to create a revolutionary public/private partnership with the support of then park commissioner Gordon Davis that would bring private monies and expertise in partnership with the City of New York to manage and restore Central Park. In 1980, the two most prominent private advocacy groups &mdash; the Central Park Task Force and the Central Park Community Fund &mdash; merged to become the Central Park Conservancy &mdash;&nbsp; the citizen-based Board of Guardians that the Savas study had essentially recommended.</p>
<p>Under a Conservancy-funded master plan, the gradual restoration of those decrepit landscapes evolved, and success bred success. As the Conservancy showed its ability to protect and maintain its investment, many more private individuals, foundations and corporations put their trust and their money into the restoration of the Park. To date, the Conservancy has had three successful capital campaigns towards rebuilding Central Park. The first campaign was launched in 1987; the second, ""The Wonder of New York Campaign,"" was launched when I made a personal challenge grant to the Conservancy and the City in 1993, and the most recent ""Campaign for Central Park,"" which ended in 2008 has ensured the completion of the Park's transformation within the next few years. Most importantly, for the first time in the Park's turbulent history, the Conservancy has created an endowment that will ensure a sustainable green and healthy future for Central Park.</p>
<p>In 1998 a historic management agreement between the Conservancy and the City of New York formalized the then 18-year public-private partnership. With that contract Douglas Blonsky, who began his career in 1985 in the Conservancy's Capital Projects office as a landscape architect supervising construction projects, assumed Betsy's title of Central Park administrator. In 2004 he assumed the additional role of president of the Conservancy and CEO, responsible for not only the Park's management but also all fundraising and administrative duties.</p>
<p>Blonsky created innovative management practices to ensure that those healthy new landscapes would have a skilled and dedicated staff to maintain them in a professional manner. His clear vision for a well-managed and well-maintained Park took the Conservancy's design and restoration vision one step further with the implementation of Zone Management System, which brought accountability, pride of workmanship, and clear and measurable results to the Conservancy and Parks Department staff under his jurisdiction. Under this pioneering system, the Park is divided into 49 geographic zones for managerial purposes, each headed by a zone gardener, who in turn supervises grounds technicians and volunteers. In this way, it is possible immediately to assess the gardener's skills and accomplishments, reward success, provide help and training if deemed necessary and, when advisable, reassign him or her to another location or, as last resort, dismiss the employee.</p>
<p>The Park's restorations gradually fostered important social changes in public behavior that returned the sanctity of public space to Central Park and ultimately to New York City at large. The American ideal of a great public park and its importance as a place to model and shape public behavior and enhance the quality of life for all its citizens once again defines the measurement of a great municipality. Towards this goal, the Conservancy was first in its demonstration of zero tolerance for both garbage and graffiti. An immediate call to action came when even the slightest sign of vandalism appeared in the Park &mdash; a busted lamppost or broken bench, for example&mdash; and became the tipping point, that turned public opinion of Central Park from one of dire repulsion to one of deep respect.</p>
<p>Today Central Park has never been more beautiful or better managed in the Park's 156-year history, and the Conservancy is proud to be the leader of the Park's longest period of sustained health and beauty. To date the Conservancy has raised $700 towards the restoration, programming and management of Central Park and is responsible for 75 percent of this year's annual operating budget of $58.3million. Furthermore, just as Central Park was the leader in the birth of urban parks, so today Central Park, through the Conservancy's innovative care and expertise, is the leader in the rebirth of urban parks, public spaces and the quality of life movement.

<p><strong>Charles A. Dana Discovery Center</strong><br /> The Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, which opened in 1993, was the first building in the Park's history to be built as a visitor center. Environmental education and activities are offered, as well as community programs, seasonal exhibits, and holiday celebrations. In the warm months, enjoy the Central Park Conservancy's free catch-and-release fishing program and the free Harlem Meer Performance Festival, two popular outdoor programs.</p>
<p><strong>Harlem Meer</strong><br /> The Park's co-designers, Olmsted and Vaux, called this man-made water body ""the Meer"" (a Dutch word meaning ""lake""), in recognition of the former swampland that was a part of Harlem, the 17th-century community established in this area by New York's first European immigrants. <br /><br /> In the 1660s, the British governors constructed the Kingsbridge Road, an east side highway that linked the growing port at the southern tip of Manhattan Island to Harlem and the British colonies to the north. The road crossed over the swamp by a series of low-lying bridges and passed through the only narrow break in the wall of steep rocky cliffs that line the southern shore of the Meer today. That opening became known as McGown's Pass, a site that played a significant role in the American Revolution. When British ships attacked the indefensible New York colony in September 1776, the British army marched up the Kingsbridge Road to McGown's Pass and captured the fortification that was placed at the pass. For the next seven years, British and Hessian troops occupied this strategically important area until their defeat in the Battle of Yorktown in 1783.</p>
<p><strong>Conservatory Garden</strong><br /> The majestic trees of North America were a source of great national pride in the 19th century and many of the entries for the 1858 design competition suggested that an arboretum be included in the Park. Olmsted and Vaux envisioned their arboretum for the northeast corner of the Park - now the site of the Conservatory Garden and the Harlem Meer. The arboretum was never established, but the Park's first formal garden - the Conservatory Garden - was created in 1898 when a large E-shaped greenhouse was constructed at Fifth Avenue and 105th Street. It featured an indoor winter garden of exotic tropical plants and outdoor decorative Victorian flowerbeds. In 1937, the deteriorated greenhouse was demolished and a new six-acre formal garden was designed for the site. <br /> The garden is divided into three distinct styles: French, Italian, and English. The French-style garden - closest to the Meer - features an ellipse of meandering boxwood and pansies, and showcases spectacular seasonal displays of tulips in spring and chrysanthemums in autumn. In the center is the charming Three Dancing Maidens fountain by German sculptor Walter Schott. The central Italian garden features an elaborate wrought-iron entrance gate and a wisteria pergola, a large lawn surrounded by clipped hedges, a 12-foot-high jet fountain (3.7 meters), and two exquisite all&eacute;es of pink and white crabapple trees on either side of the lawn. To the south is the English-style garden, featuring sculptor Bessie Potter Vonnoh's lovely Burnett Memorial fountain surrounded by flowering trees, beds of perennials and annuals, and a woodland slope.</p>
<p><strong>Fort Clinton</strong><br /> During the War of 1812 New Yorkers assumed that the British would attack from the southern tip of Manhattan Island, and they built forts in that area accordingly. But in fact the British stormed Long Island Sound at Stonington, Connecticut on August 1814. New Yorkers became fearful that the enemy would sail west through Long Island Sound and attack Manhattan from the north. In August and September several fortifications were built on the high cliffs that flanked the Kingsbridge Road (also known as the Albany/Boston Post Road). From that vantage point, the American troops could see any advancing ships from the Hudson and East Rivers and the Long Island Sound, as well as any armies coming from the northern end of Manhattan. Named after Mayor DeWitt Clinton, Fort Clinton was one of four fortifications on the site that is now Central Park. Although soldiers were stationed at the fortifications, the British never attacked New York City, and in 1815 the Treaty of Ghent ended the war.</p>

<p><strong>Belvedere Castle</strong><br /> In 1867, Calvert Vaux, Park co-designer and architect, created this fanciful observation tower as a &ldquo;belvedere,&rdquo; Italian for &ldquo;panoramic viewpoint&rdquo;. Placed atop Vista Rock, it overlooks the old reservoir (now the Great Lawn). Designed in the Norman Gothic style, the Castle is constructed of the same Manhattan schist as its promontory, giving it the magical appearance of rising out of the rock itself. <br /><br /> Central Park Mid-Park Tour MapThe United States Weather Bureau set up offices in the Castle in 1919 to monitor and report New York City's weather. In the early 1960s, the Weather Bureau installed automated meteorological instruments, and the staff vacated the building. The empty Castle deteriorated into a sad, graffiti-covered ruin. In 1983, it was restored by the Central Park Conservancy and became a popular visitor center and nature observatory. The weather instruments remain on the Castle's tower and monitor New York City's weather around the clock. When you hear &ldquo;The weather in Central Park is&hellip;&rdquo; on the radio or television, remember the information comes from Belvedere Castle in Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>King Jagiello and Turtle Pond</strong><br /> This imposing statue by Polish sculptor Stanislaw Ostrowski (1879-1947) portrays King Jagiello, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, who united Lithuania and Poland after marrying the Queen of Poland. The monument depicts the moment preceding his victory at the Battle of Grunewald of 1410 when the King crossed the two swords - handed to him by his adversaries, the Teutonic Knights of the Cross - above his head. <br /><br /> The sculpture was chosen in 1939 for the entrance to the Polish Pavilion at the World's Fair in New York. That year, the Nazis invaded Poland, preventing the sculpture's return to its homeland. In 1945 it was placed in Central Park by the Polish government as a symbol of the proud and courageous Polish people. <br /><br /> The King Jagiello statue is located at the eastern end of Turtle Pond, which attracts migrating birds and waterfowl and three species of turtles. The snapping turtles can reach nearly 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter, and can be seen sunning themselves at the waterline of Vista Rock. The nature blind, a platform that juts out into the northern side of Turtle Pond, is a wonderful place from which to observe wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>Obelisk</strong><br /> This 3,500-year-old monument stands directly behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. To celebrate the 30th year of his reign, Egyptian pharaoh Thutmosis III (c. 1479-1425 B.C.) commissioned a pair of obelisks for the sacred city of Heliopolis. In 12 B.C., they were moved to Alexandria, where they stood until the 19th century, when all great cities around the world clamored for an ancient Egyptian obelisk. The Khedive of Egypt gave one obelisk to England in 1879 and the other to America in 1881, in exchange for foreign aid to modernize his country. <br /><br /> On a snowy January 22, 1881, thousands of proud New Yorkers celebrated the turning of Central Park's 220-ton obelisk (nicknamed &ldquo;Cleopatra's Needle&rdquo;) to an upright position. The renowned filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, who fondly remembered playing in the area as a boy, donated the plaques that translate the hieroglyphics.</p>
<p><strong>Great Lawn</strong><br /> Very few people know that the Great Lawn, a luxurious green area at the geographical center of Central Park, was originally the site of the Croton Reservoir completed in 1842, fifteen years before the construction of Central Park began. With the City's increasing need for water, plans for a new water system rendered this reservoir obsolete. The reservoir was drained in 1931, filled in, andopened as a luxurious green oval in 1937. <br /><br /> The Great Lawn is better known as the venue for famous concerts and events, beginning in the 1970s. Concerts by Elton John, Diana Ross, Simon and Garfunkel, and Luciano Pavarotti; the exhibit of the AIDS Quilt; the visit of Pope John Paul II; and the film premier of Disney's Pocahontas drew enormous crowds, causing severe damage to the lawn. In addition, the site still held the subterranean walls of the old reservoir, which prevented adequate drainage, and by the 1980s the Great Lawn had turned into the &ldquo;Great Dustbowl.&rdquo; <br /><br /> From 1995 to 1997, the Central Park Conservancy and the City of New York undertook the largest single restoration in Central Park's history - the 55-acre area covering the 13-acre Great Lawn Oval and its surrounding landscapes. The Great Lawn is once again the setting for ballgames, sunbathing, and picnicking; the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic each give their two traditional performances a year. All these activities are carefully monitored in accordance with the management guidelines instituted to ensure the continuing health of the Great Lawn. <br /><br /> The Great Lawn is a particularly good place to admire some of the Park's more than 20,000 trees. The Arthur Ross Pinetum at the northern end of the Oval features 15 species and five varieties of pines.The twin linden trees inside the middle of the eastern edge of the Oval mirror each other, their intertwined branches forming an elegant heart-shaped silhouette.</p>

<p><strong>The Dairy</strong><br /> Calvert Vaux, Park co-designer and architect, designed this Victorian Gothic Revival structure with an ample loggia as a respite for Park visitors, particularly for children and invalids, where they could buy a glass of fresh milk and catch the cool summer breezes coming off the northern lobe of the Pond (now Wollman Skating Rink). However, when the building finally opened to the public in 1870, city officials established it as thePark&rsquo;s first &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; eatery. In the 1950s, the dilapidated loggia was torn down, and the remaining stone structure was reduced to a maintenance storage shed. In 1979, under the new Central Park Administration, the restored Dairy became the Park&rsquo;s first visitor center, and in 1981, the loggia was returned to its original Victorian elegance by the newly formed Central Park Conservancy. Today the Dairy is the Park&rsquo;s premier gift shop.</p>
<p><strong>Chess and Checkers House</strong><br /> In 1866, Calvert Vaux designed the largest and most elaborate rustic summerhouse in the Park for children and their caregivers, known as the &ldquo;Kinderberg&rdquo; (Dutch for children&rsquo;s mountain). The open-air shelter, made from unmilled timber, was built atop a large rock outcrop. Children and their caregivers sat at rustic chairs and tables to play games that they could borrow from the Dairy. After many years of neglect and disrepair, the structure was torn down in the early 1950s. In 1952, the present brick Chess and Checkers House was built and chess tables were placed around it, making it a haven for enthusiasts of both time-honored games. In 1984, the Chess and Checkers House was refurbished and a wisteria pergola was added. In May 2007, it reopened as the official visitor center for the Park&rsquo;s south end and as the volunteer headquarters. Visitors can borrow different games and sit at the 24 chess tables under a modern-day pergola to match wits and enjoy the summer shade.</p>
<p><strong>Wollman Skating Rink</strong><br /> When the Park was being planned, New Yorkers demanded a place for the new sport of ice skating because the rivers surrounding the island of Manhattan rarely froze. Immediately, the Pond and the Lake - both man-made water bodies - became the most popular winter destinations in the Park. Frustrated by the whims of Mother Nature, however, Park visitors wanted the guarantee of ice skating all season long. In 1950, Kate Wollman donated the money for the rink, which was placed on the northern arm of the Pond. In the 1980s, the rink was reconstructed by the City of New York with assistance from real estate developer Donald Trump, whose organization manages it today.</p>
<p><strong>The Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary</strong><br /> The Pond is one of the Park&rsquo;s masterpieces of engineering and technology. Designed to resemble a quiet woodland lake, it is actually lined with geosynthetic materials and filled with city water by subterranean pipes. Concrete shelves, constructed along the naturalistic shoreline, feature many plants and shrubs that contribute to the impression of a bucolic lagoon set deep in the woods. From the 1870s until 1924, visitors to the Pond could ride on swan boats, still a famous attraction at the Boston Public Garden. The Promontory is a rocky woodland slope that juts into the Pond. In 1934 it was renamed the Hallett Nature Sanctuary, set aside for wildlife and closed to the public. Tours of the Sanctuary are given in season by members of the Central Park Conservancy youth programs.</p>

<p>Explore some of the Park's most exceptional and beloved landscapes on the Conservancy's new Tree Discovery Walks. Wander at your own pace through three scenic routes, selected and mapped by the Conservancy's Park experts, and expand your knowledge of the Park's trees along the way. See the Park as the experts do: a rich landscape where every tree and shrub has a unique name and identity.</p>
<p>The three walks have been selected to maximize arboreal diversity along routes that offer more than just trees. Visitors will also be guided through some of the Park's most celebrated destinations, including Strawberry Fields, Bethesda Fountain, Conservatory Water and the Great Lawn. The three walks are the <strong>East Side Zofnass Walk</strong>, located between 85th and 60th Streets on the Park's east side; the <strong>Great Lawn Walk</strong>, running east-to-west between 79th and 81st Streets; and the <strong>Bethesda Walk</strong>, running east-to-west at 72nd Street. The walks feature a combined total of 125 unique tree and shrub species.</p>

<p><strong>Why do leaves change color?</strong></p>
<p>Did you know the color leaves turn during the autumn have been there all year? The pigments are masked during warmer seasons by the green chlorophyll that enables photosynthesis. As the fall begins and the days get shorter, there's dwindling sunlight for trees to convert to food. The loss of nutrients stops production of chlorophyll and, as their underlying pigments emerge, the trees begin to store energy for the winter. Once leaves fall for the winter, the Conservancy's Tree Crew takes advantage of the newly exposed trees to inspect previously hidden areas for pruning and maintenance needs.</p>
<p>The variety of colors displayed by different trees are produced by differing chemical make-ups within the leaves. Anthocyanins produce red and purple colors seen in red maples and sumacs. Carotenoids give leaves yellow and orange pigments, such as in Norway maples and ash trees. And tannins are responsible for the brown visible in leaves of many oak trees. Whatever color they turn, the Conservancy's staff and volunteers will be out in the Park raking them up to make way for winter walkers.</p>

<p>Central Park is many things to many people. The Park can be a place to relax, to enjoy nature in the midst of the City, to celebrate special occasions, to propose and marry, or just to take a walk. Whether a visitor comes to the Park just once, or every day for decades, the Park leaves lasting memories with everyone who experiences it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For over three decades, the Central Park Conservancy and its supporters have dedicated themselves to the making and keeping the Park more beautiful than ever. The decay and despair of Central Park in the 1960s and 70s left different memories with visitors &ndash; memories of broken benches, defaced monuments, and dust bowl ""lawns.""&nbsp; The Conservancy is dedicated to ensuring that the Park never goes through another period of decline again.<br /><br /><strong>Whatever your financial situation, a legacy gift to the Central Park Conservancy can help you to use the assets you have accumulated over a lifetime to meet your personal obligations to family and friends while simultaneously supporting the future of Central Park. With your help, we can create special memories in the Park for many generations to come. </strong></p>

It was in such a state of neglect &mdash; and a danger at night &mdash; that I had to take the bus to make my way across town. Throughout the 1980s, and the decades thereafter, I marveled at how the Central Park Conservancy transformed the Park from an uninviting, barren space into the joyous, nourishing place I now call my backyard.<br /><br />I understood the importance of the Conservancy's work and the need for New Yorkers to support its mission, but concerns about rising costs and approaching retirement had held me back from making the kind of substantial annual contribution I thought the Park deserved. After procrastinating for about 30 years, I decided it was high time to write my will. That's when I had an ""aha!"" moment: I realized that when I no longer have to worry about monthly maintenance, grocery, and utility bills, my savings and the revenue from the sale of my co-op would allow me to be a philanthropist.<br /><br />Then the fun really began. After making bequests to family members, I listed all of my favorite charities. The Conservancy immediately came to mind.<br /><br />A simple call to the Conservancy's Office of Planned Giving was all it took to learn how to remember the Park in my will and make sure that my wishes were honored. What a thrill it is to know that my contribution will help keep my beloved Central Park the glorious work of art and nature it has become.<br /><br /></p>

Central Park has been a lifelong friend of Lynn Barber. ""I've visited the Park since I was a little girl,"" Lynn said. ""My aunt used to take me. I thought the big rocks by the zoo were elephants with their heads buried in the soil. I would ask her who let them out."" Since then, her love of the Park has only deepened. ""My perfect day is one where I'm just free to wander. And when I think of wandering, I think of Central Park. It's the treasure of the City.""<br /><br />When she wants to relax, Lynn sits by the cafe at the Conservatory Water (familiarly known as the model boat pond) to enjoy the area's serenity and ""rejuvenate."" Lynn believes the common experience of enjoying the Park brings people together. ""I've established some real friendships just sitting there,"" she said. ""I've met artists and authors, it's amazing.""<br /><br />Like an old friend, Lynn cares about the health and future of Central Park. So, after years of support as a member of the Central Park Conservancy, she decided to give in the most generous way she can &ndash; by making the Conservancy a beneficiary of her 401(k). ""People often don't realize the options they have with retirement savings,"" Lynn said.<br /><br />In most cases, adding a beneficiary is simple. ""It just takes one phone call or a few minutes online,"" Lynn said. Since it's so easy to do, it's also easy to undo. There are no fees for setting it up, and no penalties for changing your mind. With her retirement many years away, Lynn said that making the Conservancy a beneficiary has given her a sense of security. ""I want to know where my savings are going. Central Park is perpetual; it will always be part of the City.""<br /><br />And, with the continued help of donors like Lynn, the Park can always look as good as it does today.</p>

The amount paid depends upon the age, the number of annuitants, the size of the contribution, and when payments begin. You will also receive an income-tax charitable deduction in the year the gift is made, reduced capital gains taxes (if appreciated securities are donated), and the peace of mind that comes from knowing you will receive income for life.

<ul>
<li>guaranteed payments for life at 5.8% ($580 annually)</li>
<li>$469 of the annual payment is tax free</li>
<li>a charitable deduction of $4,186</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Newhill could have chosen to defer the income from his gift for 3 years, until he is 78, and it would have increased both the rate of the payments when they began and the deduction he received for his gift. It would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>guaranteed payments for life at 7.0% ($700 annually)</li>
<li>$484 of the annual payment is tax free</li>
<li>the charitable deduction, which he can take in the year he makes the gift, increases to $4,915</li>

It enables you to make a substantial gift to Central Park over a period of years. These trusts, usually funded with an income-producing asset that is expected to appreciate, pay an income stream to the charity. At the end of the term, the assets can either revert back to you or pass to those you designate, typically your children or grandchildren. A minimum gift of $100,000 is recommended.<br /><br />Please note that appreciating assets such as stocks, real estate, and cash, are the best for funding a charitable lead trust because the assets pass to your heirs with the appreciation and without additional tax.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.pgcalc.com/giftcalcs/(S(2ogau3qyyyhpxb45itx0lv55))/Guest/Calculator.aspx?prod=5U3QQE93T%2f0%3d&amp;ref=AiG4b4h9zdI%3d"">Click here</a> to calculate your own tax savings and income benefits.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""font-size: large;"">How a Charitable Lead Trust works</span></strong><br /><br />Jim Meadows runs around the Reservoir in Central Park every morning. He greatly enjoys the running&nbsp; track, the wonderful vistas, and friends he has made there. Jim would like to make a gift to support the maintenance of the track. He is also considering how to transfer part of the family business to his son who is still quite young. By establishing a charitable lead trust he can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an income stream to the Conservancy for a number of years</li>
<li>Claim a gift tax charitable deduction that will help to offset, if not eliminate entirely, the tax on the gift of the property to his son. Even if the value of the property appreciates significantly, there will be no additional tax when his son receives the property at the end of the trust term. Additionally, his son does not take on the burden of business decisions until he is older</li>
<li>Remove the property from his taxable estate</li>
</ul>
<p>Jim will have the pleasure of knowing he is providing meaningful support for the Conservancy's work in Central Park and the running track that means so much to him.<br /><br />For more information, call our Office of Planned Giving at 212.310.6645 or email <a href=""mailto:plannedgiving@centralparknyc.org"">plannedgiving@centralparknyc.org</a>.</p>",2014 redesign - description goes here,bbell@centralparknyc.org,"Feb 04, 2014 01:13 PM CST",/2014/support/planned-giving/,2014 Default Sidebar Nav,FALSE,2014 Redesign,,none,no,,,,,,,,,,,Charitable Remainder Trusts ,charitable-remainder-trusts.html,"<p>A charitable remainder trust is a formal trust agreement through which donated assets are irrevocably transferred to a trustee (one or more individuals, a bank, or a trust company) and in return you and/or another designated person will receive income for life or for a term of years. Upon completion of the term, the assets then pass to Central Park Conservancy to support Central Park.&nbsp;When you create a charitable remainder trust, a portion of your gift is tax deductible. Because a charitable remainder trust is tailored to your specific needs, you determine the length of the trust and the payout rate &mdash; both of which have an effect on the tax deduction.<br /><br />There are two kinds of charitable remainder trusts:</p>
<ul>
<li>An annuity trust that pays a fixed income</li>
<li>A unitrust that pays a variable income</li>
</ul>
<p>Since charitable remainder trusts are flexible they can be set up to supplement retirement funds, provide educational funds for children or grandchildren, or provide support for someone you care about.

She has loved spending time in the Park her entire life and, in addition to enjoying its beauty, has been fascinated by its history. Sylvia decides to create a charitable remainder trust that will, in the future, provide for the restoration and maintenance of the Park's bridges, arches, and historic structures.<br /><br />She funds the trust with $200,000 of appreciated securities she has held for many years, which are currently yielding only about 3 percent, and sets up the trust to pay 6 percent. She knows if she sells the stock and purchases a higher-yield issue the tax on the appreciation will consume almost a third of the proceeds, leaving considerably less to reinvest. The term of the trust she establishes is for her lifetime. At the end of that time her gift will pass to Central Park Conservancy to support the maintenance and conservation of the historic structures throughout the Park.<br />&nbsp;<br />By establishing the trust she has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubled the income from her assets.</li>
<li>Avoided the capital gains tax that would be due if she had sold the stock in order to reinvest it.</li>
<li>Generated a substantial tax deduction.</li>
<li>The satisfaction of knowing she has helped preserve the history of Central Park.</li>
</ul>
<p>Appreciated assets, cash, unencumbered real estate, and retirement accounts are excellent assets to consider. No capital gains tax is due on the transfer, and you receive an income tax charitable deduction for a portion of the contribution in the year the trust is established.&nbsp; A minimum gift of about $150,000 is recommended.<br /><br />For more information, call our Office of Planned Giving at 212.310.6645 or email <a href=""mailto:plannedgiving@centralparknyc.org"">plannedgiving@centralparknyc.org</a>.<br /><br /></p>",2014 redesign - description goes here,bbell@centralparknyc.org,"Feb 04, 2014 01:13 PM CST",/2014/support/planned-giving/,2014 Default Sidebar Nav,FALSE,2014 Redesign,,none,no,,,,,,,,,,,Other Beneficiary Designations,beneficiary-designations.html,"<p>Did you know you can name the Central Park Conservancy the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, a bank or brokerage account, or an individual retirement account (IRA)? These gifts can usually be accomplished by simply contacting your insurer, bank, or broker, asking them for a beneficiary form, and designating the Conservancy as the recipient of all or part of your insurance policy's death benefit or your bank or IRA account balance. And if circumstances change, your beneficiary designation can be amended at any time &mdash; so you retain complete control of your assets during your lifetime.<br /><br /><strong>Life Insurance</strong><br />There are any number of ways to use life insurance for charitable purposes.<br /><br />Donor names charity as simple beneficiary of donor's life insurance policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What happens:</span> Donor retains access policy cash and dividends, and ability to change beneficiary. Charity receives death benefit or portion thereof at donor's death,</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tax consequences:</span> No income tax deduction or other benefit for donor since ownership of policy not transferred to charity.</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How it's done:</span> Simple execution of a change of beneficiary form by donor. Donor pays premiums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Donor buys a new policy and makes charity as owner and beneficiary.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What happens:</span> Donor relinquishes control of policy and has no access to cash value that builds.&nbsp; Charity retains rights to cash value of policy and death benefit at donor's death.</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tax consequences:</span> Donor will receive income tax deduction for any premiums he continues to pay.&nbsp; If charity picks up the payment of premiums, no tax deduction to donor.</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How it's done:</span> Apply for policy naming charity as owner and sole beneficiary; donor gifts premiums to the charity or charity makes premium payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gift of an existing policy (paid up or with premiums due) to charity making charity new owner and beneficiary</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What happens:</span> Where the life insurance is no longer required to meet personal needs of donor, policy ownership can be transferred to charity as new owner. Donor no longer has access to any cash value or dividends from the policy and relinquishes full control of policy to charity.</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tax consequences:</span> Donor will receive an income tax deduction for the lower of policy's cash value or the net premiums the donor has paid; and also an income tax deduction for additional premium gifts paid by donor.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Retirement Accounts<br /></strong>Tax deferred retirement accounts often make up a significant percentage of many estates.&nbsp; Such plans include individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and profit-sharing KEOGH plans. Most retirement plans are made up of assets which are not taxed so long as the assets remain within the plan.<br /><br />One reason that retirement accounts are often overlooked as charitable gift options is that they are often seen as quick and easy methods of transferring wealth to loved ones. However, from a tax perspective, retirement account assets are often not the best assets to leave to your family.<br /><br />If your children or your estate are named as beneficiaries of retirement plan assets, these assets will be subject to both income (to the recipient) and estate taxes (to the estate). This combined income and estate tax burden can be substantial, greatly reducing the value of the intended gift. On the other hand, retirement account assets transferred to the Conservancy, for example, (via a simple beneficiary designation that can be changed at any time) will not be taxed as income to the Conservancy&nbsp; (charities are tax-exempt) or taxed as part of your estate. Thus, if you have incorporated gifts to family and charities in your estate plans, you may want to consider making charitable gifts with retirement account funds and giving appreciated stock, real estate, or other assets to children, which will not be taxable as income to them.<br /><br /><strong>Bank / Stock Accounts, and Donor Advised Funds</strong><br />Bank and stock accounts, and donor advised funds may also name a charity(s) as beneficiary of all or a portion of the account's proceeds at the death of the owner through a simple beneficiary designation, which can be changed or revoked at any time.&nbsp; Since the donor retains ultimate control of these accounts until death, no current year income tax deduction is generated by such designations.

<p>Help the Conservancy meet the information needs of Central Park's 40 million annual visitors from all over the world. Whether they are from far-away places, or are New Yorkers who use the Park regularly, many need help navigating the Park, or have general interest questions. Enhance their experiences by greeting, guiding and informing them, whenever possible, about the importance of Central Park Conservancy's role in the Park and much more. Training is provided, and we ask for a two-year commitment to the Greeter/Guide program.<br /><br /><strong>Positions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greeter &ndash; work with a partner or on your own in pre-designated areas of the Park greeting visitors, giving directions, answering Park-related questions, providing information about upcoming events, and teaching good Park stewardship or supporting Conservancy staff at one of the Visitor Centers.</li>
<li>Tour Guide &ndash; lead public and custom walking tours throughout the Park, helping visitors discover Central Park's history, ecology, and design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training and Commitment</strong><br />All positions require some prior knowledge of the Park and completion of mandatory training. Training includes a group interview, several classroom sessions, and multiple one-on-one mentoring shifts in the Park with experienced Greeters. <strong>Tour Guides must complete the mandatory training and volunteer as a Greeter for a minimum of six months prior to being considered for the Tour Guide program.</strong><br /><br />Greeter/Guides are asked to commit three hours per week (must be the same day and time-slot each week), for a minimum two-year commitment. Shifts are available during the morning and afternoon, seven days a week. Volunteer programs take place year-round, rain or shine, except in extreme weather conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Application</strong><br />Application to be a Central Park Conservancy Greeter includes attending a mandatory group interview and then, if accepted into the program, successful completion of the training and peer mentoring. <br /><br />If you are interested in interviewing to be a Greeter/Guide please apply to be on the wait list by clicking on the link below, creating a profile (if new to CPC volunteering), then clicking the Sign-Up tab. Then scroll down to 2. Greeter/Guide Program, choose Greeter/Guide Interview - wait list, then click on the Sign Up button (please do not click on ""Add me to the back up list"").

Consider that in 2011, about 2,000 individual volunteers donated more than 40,000 hours of their time to the Park. <strong>Ina Rosenthal</strong> is one of those volunteers. For more than a year, Ina has been giving her time to the Conservancy as one of 60 <a href=""/preview!www.centralparknyc.org/volunteer/be-a-green-guide.html"">Greensward Guides</a>. She greets Park visitors, giving them directions, informing them of upcoming events, and talking to them about the Conservancy's mission.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Q: How did you begin volunteering with the Conservancy?</strong><br /><br />A: When I moved to New York City 20 years ago, I was a big power walker. I got to know Central Park really well, walking all the different paths. I thought it'd be great to volunteer as a tour guide, but at the time I was busy working as an actor. Once I had the time to commit, I started volunteering as a Greensward Guide &mdash; not a tour guide as I had first planned, but a similar role. I just thought that if I use the Park every day, I should give back to it. <br /><br /><strong>Q: What do you get out of volunteering?</strong><br /><br />A: I come home invigorated. I get to meet and help visitors from around the world, and they're so grateful. They hug you, they kiss you, they take your picture. I get so much satisfaction out of it &mdash; more than I expected. I mean, where else would I have the chance to help a young man find a romantic place to propose to his girlfriend &mdash; or talk to two Russian monks? <br /><br /><strong>Q: What's the most common question you get from visitors?</strong><br /><br />A: ""Where's Strawberry Fields?""<br /><br /><strong>Q: We thought you'd say, ""Where's the bathroom?""</strong><br /><br />A: That's the second most common.<br /><br /><strong>Q: What suggestions do you have for visitors this time of year?</strong><br /><br />A: Walk to the Lake, sit on one of the benches and just admire the view. Oh, it's just breathtaking. New Yorkers travel the world to see views that they could just as easily walk into Central Park and see. We're so lucky that the Conservancy restored the Park to what it is today and what was envisioned by the designers more than 150 years ago. I think Frederick Law Olmsted [the Park's co-designer] is smiling somewhere. And believe me, I understand it took a lot to get him to smile. <br /><br />Interested in volunteering for the Conservancy? Learn more about how you can give back to your Park.</p>

</div>


<p><a href=""#"" onclick=""cambiar('background'); return false;""><span class=""xs-icon glyphicon glyphicon-play""></span>&nbsp;<strong>BACKGROUND</strong></a></p>

<div id=""background"" style=""display: none;"">

Mr. Blonsky has been with the Central Park Conservancy since 1985. Since 2004, he has been President & CEO of Central Park Conservancy. He is also Central Park Administrator, appointed by the City in 1998 when the Conservancy formalized its partnership with the City of New York by signing the historic management contract.</p> 

<p>Mr. Blonsky oversees a staff of more than 250 and over 3,000 volunteers who contribute 52,000 hours of service each year. As a result of the proven track record of the Conservancy in renovation and supervision, the Conservancy assumed responsibility as general contractor and project manager for all Central Park capital projects, including those that are City-funded. Mr. Blonsky has been directly responsible for the effective management of $350 million in capital projects, including a number that have received prestigious design awards.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Blonsky&rsquo;s leadership, the Conservancy has completed such noteworthy restoration projects as the Great Lawn, the Harlem Meer, the Merchants&rsquo; Gate, the Mall, the Conservatory Water, the Pond, the Pool, and the Reservoir fence. He has developed several innovative Park management and preservation practices, which have set the standard for park management nationwide. The zone management system, for example, divides Central Park into 49 zones, each with a dedicated gardener who provides a uniformed presence and is held accountable for his or her zone. This system creates accountability for cleanliness and productivity improvements throughout the Park. In addition, Mr. Blonsky developed and implemented a program to train and mentor NYC Parks Department gardeners from underserved parks in all five boroughs (Neighborhood Parks Initiative). These individuals are trained by Conservancy staff in Central Park in horticulture, maintenance, and management.</p>

<p>During his tenure, Mr. Blonsky has also managed the operational logistics of some of the largest events in the Park, including The Gates; September 11th first anniversary remembrance; New York City Marathon; annual performances by the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera; concerts by Garth Brooks, Sheryl Crow, Sting, and Dave Matthews; the premiere of Disney&rsquo;s Pocahontas; and a Mass given by Pope John Paul II.</p>

<p>A graduate of the University of Delaware and Cook College at Rutgers University, Mr. Blonsky holds Bachelor of Science degrees in both Plant Science and Landscape Architecture, and is a registered landscape architect in New York State.</p>

<p>A gift annuity is a simple contract between the donor(s) and Central Park Conservancy (hereinafter ""CPC"").  In exchange for the donor's(s') contribution, CPC promises to make fixed, guaranteed payments for life to one or two annuitants (usually, but not necessarily, the donor(s)).  The amount paid is based on the age(s) of the annuitant(s), in accordance with CPC's rate schedule.</p><br/>

<p><strong>NOT A COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT</strong></p>

<p>The act of establishing a gift annuity with CPC is not, and should not be viewed as, an investment.  Rather, it is a way to receive annuity payments while making a charitable donation.  In this respect, a gift annuity issued by CPC is different from a commercial annuity.  However, the fact that you are making a charitable gift may provide you with tax benefits, including a current federal income tax charitable deduction (if you itemize your deductions), annuity payments which are partially tax-free,  and future estate tax savings.</p><br/> 

<p><strong>GIFT ANNUITY RATES</strong></p>

<p>The gift annuity rates paid by CPC and most other non-profits are those suggested by the American Council on Gift Annuities (ACGA), which is a national organization of charities that has been in existence since 1927.  These rates have been calculated so as to provide attractive payments to the donor and/or other annuitant(s) and also to result in a significant portion of the contribution remaining for the charity.  Because a charitable gift is involved, the rates are lower than those available through commercial annuities offered by insurance companies and other financial institutions.</p><br/>
  
<p><strong>ASSETS BACKING ANNUITY</strong></p>

<p>The annuity payments are a general obligation of CPC, and they are backed by all of our assets.  Assets received by CPC for gift annuities are maintained, by law, in a segregated account.  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney administers CPC&rsquo;s gift annuity account under the supervision of our Board of Trustees.  Assets held in the segregated account are invested in a conservative and disciplined manner.  Individuals entitled to receive annuity payments from CPC qualify as general creditors of CPC. Common investment funds managed by our organization are exempt from registration requirements of the federal securities laws, pursuant to the exemption for collective investment funds and similar funds maintained by charitable organizations under the Philanthropy Protection Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-62). Information in this letter is provided to you in accordance with the requirements of that Act.</p><br/>

<p><strong>POINTS TO REMEMBER</strong></p>

<ul><li>A contribution for a gift annuity is irrevocable. The principal you contribute cannot be returned to you.</li>
	  
<li>The right to annuity payments may not be assigned to any person or organization, other than CPC.</li>
	 
<li>The gift date is the date when you actually transfer assets.  In the case of cash, it is the date you mail or deliver a check.  In the case of an electronic transfer of securities, it is the date they are received into the account of CPC.  If you have certificates, it is the date they are properly endorsed and mailed or delivered.</li>
	
<li>The gift annuity is governed by applicable state laws.</li></ul>
 

<p><em>Always consult your tax professional to determine if a gift annuity is right for you.
<br/>All information provided to you by CPC is for illustration purposes only and should not be considered legal, accounting, tax, or other professional advice.</em></p>
